INSTALL:
You have to know how to install a Django application.

Upgrade notice : if you already have a Creme installation, upgrade the version one by one
(eg: do not try to upgrade from 1.1 to 1.3, upgrade to 1.2 and then 1.3).

See the creme/settings.py and set your parameters (or put them in a new file called creme/local_settings.py instead).
When you have chosen the creme apps you want (by commenting the unwanted ones), and configured the DB parameters
run the following commands in the root directory:
>> python manage.py syncdb
[if it is the initial installation, you are asked if you want to create a new user ; you should create one]

>> python manage.py migrate
>> python manage.py generatemedia
[Do not worry about 'URL not found' messages]
>> python manage.py creme_populate

And if you are upgrading from Creme 1.3:
 - Clean all existing sessions, for example like this:
    >> python manage.py shell
    > from django.contrib.sessions.models import Session
    > Session.objects.all().delete()


TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you got some problems with PIL, check if you are using the legacy PIL (that was in our old requirements) or
  its fork Pillow (new requirement). The best thing to do is first to uninstall PIL, and then install Pillow.
