== Version 2.8 Work in progress (not released -- this is a draft) ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # A detail-view for RelationType has been created; an interesting feature is
      the display of all entities linked by the concerned type, mixing all entity types.
    # The management of recent entities has been rework. They are now stored in their own table
      (their were stored in the user's session) & so their are shared between the different
      sessions of a user. The setting value 'MAX_LAST_ITEMS' has been removed;
      use the new values 'LAST_ENTITIES_SIZE' & 'LAST_ENTITIES_MENU_SIZE' instead.
      A block "Recent entities" is now available for Home; it displays more
      entities than the menu entry.
    # A user can now pin its favorite entities (up to 9 in the default configuration,
      see 'settings.PINNED_ENTITIES_SIZE'). Pinned entities are displayed in the new
      menu entry "Quick access" which displayed the recent entities too.
      A block "Pinned entities" is now available for Home.
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - The regular Users can now have several roles. Only one role is active (to compute
              the current permissions), but they can switch their current role to another one.
            - The Users store now the date of their deactivation.
            - The Roles get a new permission: listable models
              (i.e. it allows you to access the list-views of a model).
              The existing roles are migrated to keep the old behaviour: they get
              list permissions for all models belonging to allowed apps.
            - The Roles can now have special permissions.
              Two special permissions have been introduced : "User management" & "Role configuration".
            - The Roles can now be disabled.
            - The CustomFields can now get a description, which is used as help text in forms.
        * Billing :
            - Invoices, Quotes & Sales Order got a "card" hat-block, which is used by default by new installations.
            - You can now export several Invoices or Quotes at once, as a .zip archive.
            - In list-views, the columns for "Total with VAT" & "Total without VAT" display the
              Sum & Average values for these fields (on all entities related to the list).

  Developers side :
  -----------------
    - The version of 'QUnit' is now '2.24.1'.
      If you have implemented some javascript unit tests, you should probably read the upgrade guide to QUnit 2.x :
       - https://qunitjs.com/upgrade-guide-2.x/

    Non breaking changes :
    ----------------------
        # Deprecations :
            - The context processor "creme_core.context_processors.get_entities_deletion_allowed"
              is now deprecated (it injected "ENTITIES_DELETION_ALLOWED" in contexts) ;
              it has been removed from the default settings.
            - In 'creme_core.bricks', these classes have been moved :
                - 'JobResultsBrick', 'JobErrorsBrick' & 'EntityJobErrorsBrick' to 'creme_core.gui.job'.
                - 'MassImportJobErrorsBrick' to 'creme_core.creme_jobs.mass_import'.
                - 'TrashCleanerJobErrorsBrick' to 'creme_core.creme_jobs.trash_cleaner'.
            - In 'creme_core.models' :
                - The method 'header_filter.HeaderFilterManager.create_if_needed()
                 is deprecated; use the method 'proxy()' instead.
                - The method 'search.SearchConfigItemManager.create_if_needed()'
                  is deprecated; use the method 'builder()' instead.
        # The declarative possibilities of 'creme_core.management.commands.creme_populate.BasePopulator'
          have been extended; new class attributes are :
             - BUTTONS
             - HEADER_FILTERS
             - RELATION_TYPES
             - SEARCH
          Note: you should probably use 'RelationType.objects.builder()' instead of
                'RelationType.objects.smart_update_or_create()' when it's possible,
                because the last method will be removed in a futur version.
        # The models which can be used by EntityFilters (i.e. CremeEntity gets a
          ForeignKey/ManyToManyField to the model) should have a method 'portable_key()',
          & their default manager should have a method 'get_by_portable_key()'.
          See the doc-string of 'CremeEntity.portable_key()' for more details.
        # In 'creme_core.models':
             - The models 'CremePropertyType' & 'RelationType' get a JSON field
               "extra_data" which can be used by third party code.
             - The models 'EntityFilter', 'HeaderFilter' & 'UserRole' got fields "created" & "modified".
             - The models 'CremeProperty' got a field "created".
             - The models 'CremeUser' got a field "modified".
        # App :
            * Persons :
                - The model 'Address' got new fields: 'created', 'modified'.
            * Activities :
                - The model 'Calendar' got new fields: 'uuid', 'created', 'modified'.
                - The JavaScript component 'creme.ActivityCalendar' has been improved :
                    - The property 'rendererDelay' (number) has been added; Improve performances by limiting the calls
                      to the rendering methods. (see https://fullcalendar.io/docs/rerenderDelay)
            * Assistants :
                - Some fields 'creation_date' & 'modification_date' have been added in models.
            * Assistants :
                - The model 'EmailSending' got new fields: 'created', 'modified'.

        # In 'creme_core.models' :
            - In the abstract base Model 'base.MinionModel', 2 auto datetime fields
              have been added: "created" & "modified". If some of your models inherit this model, you'll
              have to create a schema migration which adds these fields (you should also fill the fields
              of the existing instances with an "epoch" value, see the file
              "creme/activities/migrations/0034_v2_8__minions_created_n_modified01.py" as example).
            - The model 'UserRole' is now ordered by 'name' (it could break some unit tests).
            - The method 'CremeUser.clean()' now raises more errors ("A regular user must have a role.").
        # In many apps, the attributes 'SEARCH' of Populator classes have changed
          (because they implemented their own API before the new generic one).

            - In the class 'StatisticsBrick', the attribute 'statistics_registry'
              has been renamed "statistic_registry".
            - The class 'JobBrick' has been removed (see 'creme_core.views.job.JobInfoBrick' instead).
        # In the class 'creme_core.core.entity_cell.EntityCellActions' the constructor argument
          'actions_registry' has been renamed "action_registry".
        # In 'creme_core.forms.fields' :
            - The attribute 'EntityCredsJSONField.quickforms_registry'
              has been renamed "quickform_registry".

              the attribute 'initial' is not a set anymore (the value you assign is not changed).

            - The method 'button_menu.Button.ok_4_display()' has been replaced by the method 'is_displayed()'.
            - The method 'bricks.Brick._render()' uses now the "template_name" found in the passed
              argument 'template_context', and not the attribute "template_name" directly anymore.
              The attribute is now injected in this context by '_build_template_context()', & so you don't have
              to change your code, excepted if you override 'self.template_name' after building the context.
            - The module 'last_viewed' has been removed.
        # The class 'creme_core.menu.RecentEntitiesEntry' has been replaced by 'QuickAccessEntry'.
        # In 'creme_core.views' :
            - The method 'creme_core.views.generic.base.BricksMixin.get_bricks()' now returns
              a dictionary instead of a list (to group Bricks per zone).
              All inheriting views have been modified, & their related templates too
              (typically "{% brick_declare bricks %}" became "{% brick_declare bricks.main %}").
              Notice that reloading views still use a list (because zones have no meaning in reloading context).
            - In the class 'generic.listview.EntitiesList':
                - the attribute 'actions_registry' has been renamed "action_registry".
                - the method 'get_actions_registry()' has been renamed "get_action_registry".
            - In the class 'quick_forms.QuickCreation', the attribute
             'quickforms_registry' has been renamed "quickform_registry".
        # In 'creme_core/templates' :
            - In "creme_core/base.html", the CSS class "main_content" of the main <div> has been removed (use "main-content" instead).
            - There is no "back" button in the template "creme_core/detailview.html" anymore.
            - Beware if you have overridden 'creme_core/bricks/frags/hat-card-title-indicators.html'
              because the new "Pinned" indicator has been added in it.
        # Apps :
            * Reports :
                - The entity model 'ReportGraph' has been replaced by the new simple model 'ReportChart'
                  (because it was not very relevant to use an CremeEntity & because the name was confusing).
                  NB: The new model have globally the same fields, but "chart" is now called "plot_name".
                    - The settings 'REPORTS_GRAPH_MODEL' have been removed.
                    - The whole app have been reworked to use the new name (core, views, bricks, templates, cloners...).
                    - The module 'graph_fetcher_registry.py' has been removed
                      (see 'core.chart.fetcher.ChartFetcherRegistry' instead).
                    - The module 'report_chart_registry.py' has been removed
                      (see the new module 'core.chart.plot' instead).

            * Documents :
                - The methods 'populate.Populator._populate_header_filters_for_*()' have been removed.
            * Persons :

                    - The content of the class attribute 'BUTTONS' has changed
                      (it now contains 'ButtonMenuItemProxy' instances).
                    - The methods '_populate_header_filters_for_*()' have been removed.
            * Activities :
                - The content of the class attribute 'populate.Populator.BUTTONS' has changed
                  (it now contains 'ButtonMenuItem' instances).
                - In the following Brick classes, "is_home" is not injected in the template's context anymore:
                  FutureActivitiesBrick, PastActivitiesBrick, MyActivitiesCalendarBrick
            * Billing :
               - The class 'actions.ExportAction' has been renamed '_ExportAction'.
               - These methods of 'populate.Populator' have been removed :
                    - _populate_buttons_config_for_*()

                    - _populate_header_filters_for_*()
               - The module 'views.convert' has been renamed "conversion".
            * Commercial :
                - The methods 'populate.Populator._populate_header_filters_for_*()' have been removed.
            * Emails :
                - These Brick classes are not registered anymore (so they can only be reloaded by their specific view):
                  SendingBrick, SendingHTMLBodyBrick, MailsBrick.
                - The class attribute 'views.sending.SendingBricksReloading.allowed_bricks'
                  has been replaced by the new attribute 'bricks'.
            * CTI :
                - The class bricks.CallersBrick is not registered anymore (so it can only be reloaded by its specific view).

    Internal breaking changes :
    ---------------------------
    (they should not cause problem if you have not deeply modified the source code of Creme)

        # In the class 'creme_core.gui.button_menu.ButtonRegistry', the methods
          'get_buttons()' & 'mandatory_buttons()' get keywords arguments only now,
          an get a new mandatory argument "request".
        # The method 'creme_core.bricks.ButtonsBrick._get_buttons()' get a new mandatory argument "request".


== Version 2.7 ==

  UPGRADE NOTES :
    - If you upgrade your MariaDB server to 10.7+, you have to convert all the UUID fields
      (which were just CharFields before MariaDB 10.7) to real UUID fields
      See "creme/creme_core/migrations/migrate_uuid.sql" ; copy it & remove the
      lines related to app which are not installed) before importing it.

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The minimal version of Python is now '3.10'.
    # The version of Django has been upgraded to '5.2' ; for users it means that :
        - Python '3.13' is officially supported.
        - The minimal version of SQLite is now '3.31'.
        - The minimal version of MySQL is now '8.0.11'.
        - The minimal version of PostgreSQL is now '14'.
        - The minimal version of MariaDB is now '10.5' ;
          the UUID fields may have to be manually converted if you use MariaDB 10.7+ (see the upgrade notes above).
        - The URL fields assume "https" by default ; set the setting 'FORMS_URLFIELD_ASSUME_HTTPS' if you prefer "http"
          (this setting will be removed with Django 6.0 -- & so Creme 2.9 or something like that).
    # A warning is now displayed if the settings 'SITE_DOMAIN' is not correctly defined.
    # A new mandatory app has been added: "Custom entities".
      It allows users to create their own types of entity without coding.
        - You can create up to 20 types.
        - The new types have just one regular field ("name"), you can add custom-field as usual.
        - BEWARE: if you upgrade from a previous version of Creme, 'creme.custom_entities' must be
          in your 'settings.INSTALLED_APPS' (it should be OK it you did not modify it or have modified as advised).
    # A Workflow engine has been added; it allows to configure from the UI some automatic actions.
        - Current events which can trigger a Workflow :
          entity creation, entity edition, relationship adding, property adding.
        - Current available actions :
            - Add a property
            - Add a relationship
            - Send an email (needs the app 'emails').
      Note: a new middleware has been added in the default settings 'MIDDLEWARE' : "WorkflowMiddleware".
            You should add it in you have your own definition of this variable.
    # The deletion & cloning buttons have been reworked in detailed views & list-views;
      they are now disabled when a rule avoids you to delete them (e.g. a Contact corresponding
      to a user) & the reason is displayed as tool-tip.
    # The deletion views have been improved :
        - The dependencies issues have now a better display.
          Example: entities are displayed as HTML links.
        - A Property type cannot be deleted if it is used by :
            - A property (i.e. one entity is tagged at least).
            - A RelationType (as a constraint).
            - A condition of EntityFilter.
            - A trigger of Workflow.
        - A Relationship type cannot be deleted if it is used by :
            - A Relationship (i.e. 2 entities are linked at least).
            - A condition of Filter.
        - A CustomField cannot be deleted if it is used by :
            - A condition of EntityFilter.
            - A condition of Workflow.
    # The HeaderFilters (views of list) & EntityFilters have been improved :
        - The ones without owner can now only be edited/deleted by superusers in the default
          configuration ; a SettingValue has been added to allow all users to edit/delete them
          (it was the behaviour in previous versions).
        - They can now be cloned.
        - EntityFilters are now grouped by owner in list-views, like HeaderFilters.
    # The Currencies have now a "Is default?" field to chose the Currency
      which is pre-selected in forms (Invoices, Quotes, Opportunities...).
    # In the notification box, the elapsed time from message creation is now updated each minute.
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - The buttons configuration can now be customised per role.
            - The property types have now a field "description" (it can be empty of course).
            - In the bricks configuration, the default configuration is used as initial
              value when it's relevant (instead of starting with an empty configuration).
            - In the relation types configuration, you can now edit the "minimal display" value for standard types.
            - A view which displays all "FileRefs" (temporary files) has been added; it's only available for staff users.
            - A VAT cannot be edited if it's already referenced by an instance (classically a billing Line).
              The VAT value is also unique now (but this is not retroactive yet).
        * Persons :
            - A new optional field has been added to 'Organisation': "code".
              You can use it to distinguish you managed organisations when you get several ones.
              Upgrade note:
                if you upgrade from an instance of Creme 2.6, you have to configure your blocks to display
                this field if you want to see it. As the field is optional, you can also hide it to remove
                it everywhere (notably forms).
            - A new optional field has been added to 'Organisation': "eori".
              This field stores the Economic Operators Registration and Identification number
              required for custom clearance regarding import and export in/out of the EU.
            - The Contact field "Skype" is now named "Videoconference".
        * Documents :
            - A new field, automatically filled, has been added to Document: "file_size".
        * Activities :
            - The calendar has been improved :
                - The JavaScript component 'FullCalendar' has been upgraded to the version "6.1.18".
                - The CSS of the sidebar has been improved; and it's now sticky.
                - In the calendar configuration, the visible hours range is added.
                  It can be different from "business hours" which are setting constraints to Activities.
            - New bricks are now available :
                - A "card" brick for the hat of the Activities' detail-view.
                  It's used by default by the new installations.
                - A brick "My Calendar" for the home page.
            - A field of 'Activity', "Fixed or floating?" (internal name: 'floating_type') is now visible.
        * Billing :
            - The number generation has been heavily reworked. The old number generation system
              took a prefix in settings, then generated numbers like "PREFIX15".
              The new system can be visually configured & is more powerful :
                - The configuration takes now a format string.
                  There is a mandatory variable "{counter}", but other variables are also available:
                  "{year}", "{month}" & "{code}" (which corresponds to the new field 'Organisation.code').
                - The counter can be reset annually/monthly.
                - The counter can be manually edited (it's useful after a mass-import to keep a consistent numbering).
                - The manual edition of the number can be forbidden.
              Notice that if you upgrade from Creme2.6, your existing configuration is migrated &
              you should not see difference for Invoices/Quotes/Sales Orders.
              The numbers for Credit Notes are not automatically generated at their creation anymore.
              These variables in settings.py have been removed :
                - QUOTE_NUMBER_PREFIX
                - INVOICE_NUMBER_PREFIX
                - SALESORDER_NUMBER_PREFIX
            - Since always, these actions are automatically performed :
                - The target of a Quote becomes a prospect of the emitter.
                - The target of an Invoice becomes a supplier of the emitter.
                These behaviours are now implemented as Workflows (so you could disable them for example).
            - It's now forbidden by default to edit the source Organisation of a Invoice/CreditNote when a number is set.
              This behaviour can be changed in the configuration portal of 'billing'.
            - The 'Convert to ...' buttons have been reworked :
                - When a button is disabled, the reason is now displayed as tool-tip.
                - The constraints for properties & relationships are better respected.
            - In the list-views for Product/Service lines, lines related to deleted Invoice/Quote/... are now excluded.
            - The LaTex backend (for PDF export) replaced 'PDFLaTeX' with 'latexmk' and 'LuaTeX' as LaTex compiler.
              This change requires the additional system package 'latexmk' to be installed;
              see README for a better packages list if you use this backend.
        * Opportunities :
            - You can now create unsuccessful phone calls from an Opportunity's detail-view :
                - A button has been added (not enabled in default installations).
                - In the block "Linked Contacts", you can activate an new action in the configuration (idem).
            - Since always, the target of an Opportunity automatically becomes a prospect of the emitter.
              This behaviour is now implemented as Workflows.
            - A new behaviour has been added with a Workflow:
              the target of a won Opportunity becomes a customer of the emitter.
            - The field 'Opportunity.chance_to_win' checks now that the value is between 0 & 100.
        * Assistants :
            - The app permissions are now used by the blocks & function-fields;
              users which cannot access this app cannot view their content anymore
              (so you may have to update some roles if you have upgraded from Creme 2.6).
            - You cannot create Alert with a dynamic trigger date related to the field
              "Last modification" ('modified' in the code) anymore.
              The existing Alerts (& which use this field) are migrated to static trigger dates.
        * Crudity :
            - BEWARE: the date format corresponds now to your server's language (i.e. 'settings.LANGUAGE_CODE').

  Developers side :
  -----------------
    - The version of 'Django' is now "5.2".
      You should probably read the following releases notes for Django versions :
        - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/5.0/
          Some important items :
            - The "logout" view uses now POST only.
            - The 'settings.py' value 'USE_L10N' has been removed.
            - The management of choices (models & forms fields) have been reworked ;
              it caused an issue during our upgrade with a strange couple form-field/form-widget which
              uses 3-tuples (see 'creme.emails.forms.sending.SendingConfigField' if you have an identical issue).
              The class 'django.forms.fields.CallableChoiceIterator' has been removed ;
              use 'django.utils.choices.CallableChoiceIterator' instead.
        - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/5.1/

        # A new module 'creme_core.core.snapshot' has been added to get the changes which occurred
          on a model since its loading; it's already used by the history system & the new workflow engine.
        # In 'creme_core.forms' :
            - In the class 'fields.GenericEntityField', the attribute "autocomplete" is now <True> by default.
            - In the class 'widgets.CTEntitySelector', the attribute "autocomplete" is now <True> by default.
        # In 'creme_core.models' :
            - The class 'django.db.models.Model' is contributed to add a method 'get_m2m_values()'
              which manages cached lists of instances linked by the 'ManyToManyFields'.
            - The model 'CremeUser' :
                - gets a new field 'uuid'.
                - gets a new method 'has_perm_or_die()' which raises exceptions with friendly error messages.
            - The model 'FileRef' :
                - gets a new optional field "description"; it's used by the new view
                  which displays all FileRefs (so feel free to fill it in your own code).
                - the field 'filedata' has now a max_length equal 500 (it was 200 previously).
                  As the previous value was smaller than 'documents.Document.filedata.max_length',
                  it could cause issue when deleting a Document with a long name.
        # A new method 'creme_core.tests.base._CremeTestCase.clear_global_info()' has been added.
        # In 'creme_core.utils' :
            - The 'CremeDiscoverRunner.setup_databases' method has been updated to prevent running
              the 'creme_populate' command on the default test database when the test suite is launched in
              parallel mode. This change is done to prevent cache leaking when the test processes are forked.
        # In Javascript :
            - The method '_.pop()' has been added to work like Python 'dict.pop()'.
            - The class 'RelativeURL' has been added as an alternative of 'URL' which does not accept
              relative paths (e.g. '/list?page=1' is not a valid URL).
            - In 'creme.dialog' :
                - In the component 'FormDialog', the forms which submit error responses
                  with HTML can either replace the default overlay content or the frame content.
                - A new option for 'Frame' has been added: 'fillOnError'.
                  If it's enabled, the HTML error response replaces the content.
                - A new option for 'Dialog' has been added : 'fillFrameOnError'.
                  If it's enabled, the HTML error response replaces the content.
                - The component 'creme.dialog.PopoverAction' works now better with HTML content
                  (e.g. it allows usage of links) because it accepts now <script type="*/html">
                  or DOM queries for the content.
        # Apps :
            * Persons :
                - The model 'Address' gets new semantic fields (like ZipCodeField) which allow to
                  easily customise things (like the form field, the field printer etc...).
            * Activities :
                - A new 'FullCalendarBrick' base class for calendar bricks has been added.
                - The JavaScript component 'creme.ActivityCalendar' has been improved :
                    - The flag 'headlessMode' has been added.
                    - The property 'allowEventOverlaps' (boolean or method) has been added.
                    - The property 'allowEventCreate' (boolean) has been added.
            * Billing :
                - The model 'PaymentInformation' got 2 new fields: 'uuid' & 'extra_data'.
            * Emails :
                - The model 'EmailSignature' got a new field 'uuid'.
            * Geolocation :
                - These URLs used in brick controllers (JavaScript) can be overridden in Python code now
                  (so it does not require to override an entire template) :
                    - DetailMapBrick.update_address_url
                    - FilteredMapBrick.addresses_url
                    - NeighboursMapBrick.neighbours_url
                - Markers with custom icons are now supported in maps :
                    - The new registry 'geomarker_icon_registry' allows to register an icon for a model.
                    - The new setting key 'geolocation-use_entity_icon_key' enables the feature.
                - The JSON data of 'creme.geolocation.PersonsBrick()' controller is now stored in a script.

            - Apps :
                * Activities:
                    - The JavaScript component 'creme.ActivityCalendar' has been reworked to be used as independent component.
                        - These features for the classical calendar view have been moved to 'creme.ActivityCalendarController' :
                          floating events, sidebar selection, state within URL hash.
                        - The calendar selection state queries have been moved to 'ActivityCalendarController'.
                * Persons :
                    - The form class 'forms.contact.ContactNamesForm' has been removed.
                    - The class-view 'views.contact.ContactNamesEdition' has been removed.

        # The settings 'ENUMERABLE_REGISTRATION_ERROR' is now <True> by default.
        # The deletion of CremeEntities has been reworked in order to allow the customisation without having to write your own view.
            - If your model could be deleted in Creme 2.6 with the generic deletion view (i.e. you did not define your own view)
              you must now register your model in the new registry for deletion. In you "apps.py" :
                  def register_deletors(self, entity_deletor_registry):
                      entity_deletor_registry.register(model=MyModel)
            - If you disabled the deletion with the method 'get_delete_absolute_url()' returning an empty string,
              you should just remove this method to avoid some warning messages.
            - If you wrote your own deletion view (i.e. your model defines 'get_delete_absolute_url()'), you should
              probably use the new 'Deletor' system to write your custom rules. You'll have less code to maintain,
              and your checks will be used to disabled the deletion buttons or by the trash cleaner job.
              Hint: see the method 'creme.persons.apps.PersonsConfig.register_deletors()' as example.
        # The cloning of CremeEntities has been reworked in order to allow the customisation without having to write your own view.
            - If your model could be cloned in Creme 2.6 with the generic cloning view (i.e. you did not define your own view)
              you must now register your model in the new registry for cloning. In you "apps.py" :
                  def register_cloners(self, entity_cloner_registry):
                      entity_cloner_registry.register(model=MyModel)
            - If you disabled the cloning with the method 'get_clone_absolute_url()' returning an empty string,
              you should just remove this method to avoid some warning messages.
            - If you wrote your own cloning view (i.e. your model defines 'get_clone_absolute_url()'), you should
              probably use the new 'Cloner' system to write your custom rules. You'll have less code to maintain,
              and your checks will be used to disabled the cloning buttons.
              Hint: see the method 'creme.persons.apps.PersonsConfig.register_cloners()' as example.
        # The format used to store 'EntityCells' in JSON has slightly changed (so in custom Brick configuration, global search configuration...).
          When the cell is related to a 'CustomField', the key "value" contains now the UUID, not the ID anymore.
          You won't be impacted unless you read the JSON directly (why would you do this bro?).
          In the model 'RelationBrickItem', the way ContentTypes are stored in the field "json_cells_map" has changed too;
          a natural key with the pattern "app.modelname" is used instead of the ID.
        # The method 'creme_core.bricks.ButtonsBrick._get_buttons()' has a new mandatory argument.
        # In 'creme_core.core' :
            - In 'entity_cell', in the methods 'EntityCell*.build()' :
                - The second argument is now always named "name" (e.g. it was named "customfield_id" in 'EntityCellCustomField.build()').
                - The extra arguments are now keyword only (.e.g. 'EntityCellRegularField' & "is_hidden").
            - In 'entity_filter.condition_handler' :
                - The constructor of 'FilterConditionHandler' takes only keyword arguments now.
                - In the 'FilterConditionHandler' & its child classes :
                    - The class attribute 'efilter_registry' is now a read-only property;
                      use the new setter 'efilter_type' if you have to change the registry.
                    - The constructor & the class-method 'build()' get new mandatory argument "efilter_type".
                - The class-methods of 'OperatorConditionHandlerMixin' are now classical methods.
        # In 'creme_core.forms' :
            - The class 'widgets.ColorInput' has been removed; use 'django.forms.widgets.ColorInput' instead.
              The related template file has been removed too.
            - In 'entity_filters' :
                - The constructor of the field classes take now an argument "efilter_type" instead of "efilter_registry".
                - The constructor of the widget classes 'RegularFieldsConditionsWidget' & 'CustomFieldsConditionsWidget'
                  take now an argument "efilter_type" instead of "efilter_registry".
        # In 'creme_core.gui' :
            - In the class 'bricks.Brick', the method 'has_perms()' has been removed;
              use the new method 'check_permissions()' instead.
            - In the class 'button_menu.Button', the method 'is_allowed()' has been removed;
              use the new method 'check_permissions()' instead. In the template of your button,
              you must also use the variable "button.permission_error" instead of "button.is_allowed".
            - In the class 'menu.MenuEntry', the method '_has_perm()' has been removed;
              use the new method 'check_permissions()' instead.
        # In 'creme_core.models' :
            - In the abstract class 'MinionModel', the field "is_custom" is now marked <editable=False> ;
              it will at least need a migration (or a manual change in the existing migrations because
              it has no consequence on the DB).
            - In the model 'CremeEntity' :
                - The field "extra_data" is now tagged as <clonable=False>;
                  use the new cloning system to clone precisely what you want.
                - The method 'get_clone_absolute_url()' is not static anymore.
            - The model-field 'CremeProperty.type' is now <on_delete=models.PROTECT>.
            - The model-field 'Relation.type' is now <on_delete=models.PROTECT>.
            - The method 'BrickDetailviewLocationManager.create_if_needed()' now takes its arguments as keywords only.
            - In 'CremeUser' :
                 - The first argument of the following methods is now positional only :
                    - has_perm_to_create() & has_perm_to_create_or_die()
                    - has_perm_to_link() & has_perm_to_link_or_die()
                    - has_perm_to_export() & has_perm_to_export_or_die()
                    - has_perm_to_access() & has_perm_to_access_or_die()
                    - has_perm_to_admin() & has_perm_to_admin_or_die()
                 - The method 'has_perms()' returns <True> if you pass an empty argument, for consistency
                   (you did probably not use this case).
            - In 'CustomFieldMultiEnum' :
                - The attribute '_enumvalues' has been removed.
                - The method 'get_enumvalues()' now returns a list, not a 'QuerySet' anymore.

                - can_create()
                - can_export()
            - The field 'fields.DatePeriodField' does not accept strings as value anymore;
              but you can now initialize it with a dictionary (e.g. {'type': 'days', 'value': 1}).
        # The method 'creme_core.populate.Populator._populate_optional_currencies()' has been removed.
        # The classes inheriting 'creme_core.utils.date_range.DateRange' should implement the new method 'accept()'.
        # In 'creme_core.views' :
            - In 'generic', the class-views 'CremeModelCreation' & 'CremeModelEdition' now check the
              app permission (aka 'user.has_perm_to_access(...)') for the concerned model.
            - In 'entity' :
                - The class-view 'EntityRestoration' now just checks the deletion credentials & the attribute "is_deleted".
                - The mixin 'EntityDeletionMixin' has been heavily reworked :
                    - The method 'delete_entity()' takes a new mandatory argument "deletor".
                    - The methods 'check_entity_for_deletion()' & 'move_to_trash()' have been removed.
                - The class-view 'RelatedToEntityDeletion' now checks the app permission for the
                  concerned model (it was just checking permission for the related entity).
            - In 'creme_property' :
                - The brick classes have changed (attributes, data injected in templates).
                - The method 'PropertyTypeDetail.get_bricks()' returns now a dictionary.
        # In templates :
            - The buttons parts of the hat bricks have changed in order to manage the new deletion & cloning systems
              (good news, some {% block %} have been added) :
                - "creme_core/bricks/base/hat-card.html"
                - "creme_core/bricks/generic/hat-bar.html"
        # In Javascript :
            - The method 'creme.widget.ChainedSelect.clone()' has been removed (it was not used and did not work anyway).

            - In 'creme.utils', the functions 'confirmPOSTQuery()' & 'confirmAjaxQuery()' have been removed;
              use 'creme.utils.ajaxQuery' with the option "confirm: true" instead.
        # Apps :

                          system, which is derived from the new cloning system.
                          This new system is de-coupled from the clone & conversion systems;
                          it should be easier to customise from another app.
                    - The field 'Line.on_the_fly_item' is now blank=True (again), to avoid some annoying messages with the new Snapshot system.

            * Emails :
                - In the brick classes 'ContactsBrick' & 'OrganisationsBrick',

                    - "polls__create_reply_from_pform"    => "polls__create_replies_from_pform"
                    - "polls__create_reply_from_campaign" => "polls__create_replies_from_campaign"
                    - "polls__create_reply_from_person"   => "polls__create_replies_from_person"
            * SMS :
                - In the brick class 'ContactsBrick', the variable "field_hidden" is not injected anymore.

== Version 2.6 ==

  UPGRADE NOTES :
    - You should create a all new virtual environment based on Python 3.8+ (as usual).
    - Some MariaDB users encountered errors when running migrations.
      The following workaround has worked for them:
      First, try to run the migrations again (as long as the error is a new one).
      It the same error is raised, get the raw SQL code with the command <creme sqlmigrate --settings=... app_label migration_name>
      (with the name of the migration which fails of course), then execute line after line the SQL commands in a MariaDB shell.
      You will get errors for things which have already be done, it's OK; then, you can run the command 'migrate' again.

  Users side :
  ------------
    # A notification system has been added. The notifications are sent to channels, and users can configure
      them in order to their notifications are displayed in the browser and/our received by emails.
        - A new job which sends notification emails has been created.
        - The reminder system (used by Alerts & ToDos) has been reworked to create notifications (instead of sending emails).
        - Some events produce now a notification : the end of mass import, an administrator changed your password...
        - Staffs users can sent a notification to announce a system upgrade (there is a button in the new page which display all your notifications).
          A new command "creme_announce" has been created to do the same thing from the shell.
    # The list-views with a big number of entities & no explicit sort now works correctly (i.e. not duplicate).
      The mass-export & the exploration mode now accept to be used in this case.
    # In the detail-view for property type, a button to delete all the properties with this type
      (and related to a given entity type) has been added.
    # A detail-view for EntityFilter has been added; in addition to the usual information,
      it displays the entities which are linked to the filter (currently only Reports).
    # A role "Regular user", which can do everything excepted administrating apps, is created in new installations.
    # Many fields of User are now viewable; it can be useful for particular filters.
    # The Custom-Fields with type 'URL' are not validated anymore.
      You can now omit the protocol (i.e. "http://"), or use local URLs without domain;
      it should avoid some annoying errors when importing from csv/xls files.
    # Thanks to the library "openpyxl", XLSX files should be better managed now for import, & export proposes this file format now.
      BEWARE: if you use a custom list for 'IMPORT_BACKENDS' in your settings,
              the value "creme.creme_core.backends.xls_import.XLSXImportBackend" is now invalid.
              You should use "creme.creme_core.backends.xlsx_import.XLSXImportBackend" instead.
    # In global search, forbidden models are not proposed anymore.
    # The button menu has been reworked; it can now be reloaded dynamically
      (e.g. some buttons reloaded the whole page in order to be hidden -- or change their label -- once they did their job).
    # Seconds are now displayed as tool-tip for datetime fields.
    # The command "creme_populate" now returns a correct error code if an error happened.
    # The JQPlot compatibility has been dropped.
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - The bricks configuration of a role can be cloned from the configuration of another role.
        * Activities :
            - The JavaScript component FullCalendar has been upgraded to the version "5.11.4" :
                - New calendar look-n-feel.
                - Week/month view changes are now in browsing history ; after a refreshing you will stay on the same view.
                - Collisions between events from the same calendar are forbidden.
                - The "busy" events (no collision)are displayed with a stripped background.
            - A configuration system for the calendar view has been added :
                - Default view can be "month" or "week".
                - Which days are active.
                - What hour range to use.
                - ...
            - Teams have a default Calendar since years, but they were unused;
              now, when you select a team as a participant, the Activity is put on the team's Calendar too.
              The default Calendar of a team is always public, & a data migration remove the extra Calendars.
            - A new button, which can be displayed on Contacts' detail-views, is available: "Create an unsuccessful phone call".
            - The configuration block for Calendars has been improved.
        * Persons :
            - The staff users are not related to Contacts anymore.
              Note: the existing Contacts which were related to staff users are sent to the trash.
            - A button to transform a Contact into a user has been added.
            - The URL fields of Contacts & Organisations are not validated anymore (see remarks about URL CustomFields above).
        * Reports :
            - You can now create filters which are reserved to Reports.
            - The Graphes using Relationships have been improved :
                 - the SQL queries should be more efficient.
                 - the entities in abscissa are now ordered by their name.
                 - the length of the URL to list-view remains always short (& so it avoids issue with URLs which reach the server's limit).
            - The date fields of referenced models can be used for temporal filtering in the Reports
              (e.g. in a report on Contacts, Photograph's fields are available).
            - The fields with 'choices' (e.g. status of EntityEmails) can now be used as Graphes' abscissa.
            - A new type of chart is available: 'linechart'.
            - Graphs with an enumerable abscissa are now using its color if exists (e.g. billing status).
        * Assistants :
            - The UserMessages produce now notifications (so users can chose to be notified in their browser, emails are not the only way anymore).
        * Billing :
            - You can now define the default statuses (which are notably used as initial values in creation forms).
              You can also define the Invoice status to use when a number ins generated.
            - When you clone an Invoice, the status is not copied anymore; the new Invoice gets the default status instead.
            - When you edit an Invoice/Quote/... & change the target, the addresses of the new target are copied.
              In the CSV/XLS import, the options to enable the addresses overriding have been removed because they are now meaningless.
        * Emails :
            - The spam score of sent emails should be better :
                - the header contains a "Message-ID" which matches the host domain.
                - the "content-ID" of inline images matches the host domain.
            - The render of inlined images has been improved.
        * Geolocation :
            - The bricks which use OpenStreetMap are now used in the default installation (instead of the GoogleMaps ones).

          override the classes used by the command "creme_populate".
          Many classes 'Populate' have been reworked to facilitate their modification by inheritance ;
          the work has been split into several methods, and class attributes with declarative values have been added.
        # In 'creme_core.models' :
            - A class attribute 'CremeEntity._DELETABLE_INTERNAL_RTYPE_IDS' has been added to avoid writing
              methods '_pre_delete()' to manage the internal Relationships.
            - The class 'UserRole' has 2 new fields: uuid & extra_data (a JSONField which can be used to store whatever you want).
            - Some methods of 'CremeUser' accept instances of auxiliary models (i.e. with a method 'get_related_entity()')
              which do not inherit 'CremeEntity': has_perm_to_view*(), has_perm_to_change*(), has_perm_to_delete*().

              which contains an error message when the attribute 'Brick.permissions' does not pass the validation.
              This attribute has been set for many Brick classes in order to use this new behaviour.
            - The class-view 'views.entity.EntityDeletion' now accepts explicit callback URL.
        # In the class 'creme_core.core.setting_key.SettingKey', you can now pass :
             - a custom form-field class.
             - a custom renderer function.
        # In 'creme_core.gui' :
            - In the class 'bricks._BrickRegistry', 3 methods to unregister brick classes have been added.
            - In 'button_menu' :
                - The classes inheriting 'Button' can now define an attribute "dependencies" (like Brick classes) to have a dynamic reloading;
                  their template can now use the actions available to Bricks.
                - In the class 'ButtonsRegistry' :
                    - A method 'unregister()' has been added.
                    - A button class can now be registered as mandatory, to be always displayed without
                      having to hard code them in the detail-view template.
            - A method 'bulk_update.FieldOverrider.post_save_instance()' has been added
              (it's useful to manage ManyToManyFields, Relationships, CremeProperties...).
            - A method 'custom_form.CustomFormDescriptorRegistry.unregister()' has been added.
            - A method 'mass_import.FormRegistry.unregister()' has been added.
            - A method 'merge._MergeFormRegistry.unregister()' has been added.
        # In 'creme_core.templatetags.creme_bricks', the tag {% brick_action %} accepts a new boolean argument 'comeback' ;
          once enabled it will add a GET argument 'callback_url' with the current location (client side).
          All derived tags (like {% brick_table_action %}) accept this argument too, of course.
        # Apps :
            * Creme_config:
                - In the class 'registry._ConfigRegistry', some methods to unregister brick classes have been added.
                - Many portals have been reworked to store the list of displayed Brick as a class attribute.

            * Activities:
                - The models 'ActivityType' & 'ActivitySubType' now inherit 'creme_core.models.MinionModel' (see <Breaking changes> part too).
                - The upgrade of FullCalendar came with the following changes :
                    - these views use ISO8601 format WITH timezone (e.g 2023-04-14T10:38:30+01:00) :
                         - activities__calendars_activities
                         - activities__set_activity_dates
                    - The timezone used is the one provided by the user information instead of the browser's one.
            * Reports:
                - The graphes with type 'creme.D3TubeChart' now support color field from data.
            * Sketch:
                - The new type of chart 'creme.D3LineChart' draws a curved line with (optional) dots and tooltips.
                - The new chart component 'creme.d3Tooltip' allows to render HTML tooltips.
                - New 'creme.d3BisectScale' that retrieve the value scale source value from the position in a chart.
                - The type of chart 'creme.D3DonutChart' now supports color field from data.
                - The new functions 'd3.axisRadialInner()' & 'd3.axisRadialOuter' draw axis for gauge meters.

                    - Do not rely on $.ajaxSettings.traditional (deprecated since jQuery 1.9+) :
                        - creme.ajax.param() will always use traditional mode
                        - creme.ajax.jqueryFormSubmit() will use traditional mode as default.
            - Apps :

                    - The class 'forms.fields.CustomEnumChoiceField has been removed.
                * Activities :

                        - GraphFetchingInstance (reports__fetch_graph_from_brick)
                * Events :
                    - The class 'gui.RelatedContactsActionsRegistry' have been renamed "RelatedContactActionRegistry".
        # The way the Bricks' IDs are generated & used has been reworked.
          These IDs have always be designed to retrieve the Bricks classes (on Python/server side), but in facts they were used for the HTML "id" attribute too.
          Now these uses are more distinct ; the IDs of classes do not contain a prefix with "brick"/"block" (because it's useless),
          & the prefixes of different types of brick have been reworked :
            - The value of 'creme_core.constants.MODELBRICK_ID' changed from "modelblock" to "model".
            - The value of 'creme_core.gui.bricks.Brick.GENERIC_HAT_BRICK_ID' changed from "hatbrick" to "hat".
            - The method 'creme_core.gui.bricks.Brick.generate_id()' returns strings which start now by "regular-" (it started previously by "block_").
          The values for the attributes "brick_id" stored in Data Base (see models in 'creme_core.models.bricks') are fixed by a migration.
          In HTML, the Brick class' ID is now stored in the HTML attribute "data-brick-id", & the HTML attribute "id"
          is created as "brick-{{brick_id}}" (see 'creme/creme_core/templates/creme_core/bricks/base/base.html').
          So you'll have to fix your template files if you retrieve bricks nodes by their ID. Example :
            $('.brick[id="{{brick_id}}"]')   =>   $('.brick[data-brick-id="{{brick_id}}"]')
        # The way the Buttons for CremeEntities (see "view_entity.html") are managed has changed.
          They are now wrapped into a Brick (the well-named "ButtonsBrick") & use brick actions.
          If you defined custom actions for a CremeEntity class, the code to register your actions have to be modified in order it keeps working :
          Old code :
             $(document).on('hatmenubar-setup-actions', '.ui-creme-hatmenubar', function(e, actions) {...}
          New code :
             $(document).on('brick-setup-actions', '.creme_core-buttons-brick', function(e, brick, actions) {...}
        # The way the values are stored in 'creme_core.models.SettingValue' has changed.
          The field "value_str" (TextField) has been replaced by "json_value" (JSONField).
            - Now when you store an empty string, you retrieve an empty string, not <None>.
            - If you have defined your own 'SettingKey', you have to write migration for the related 'SettingValue'
              (because in migration mode, 'apps' are not initialized as usual, so the core cannot know your 'SettingKey').
              You should just copy "creme/activities/migrations/0027_v2_6__settingvalue_json.py" and modify :
                 - The function 'fill_json()' to use your own 'SettingKeys'.
                 - The dependency <('activities', '0026_v2_6__fix_status_uuids')>.
        # In 'creme_core.core' :
            - In 'entity_filter' :
                - The constants 'EF_USER' & 'EF_CREDENTIALS' are now strings.
                - The class 'condition_handler.PropertyConditionHandler' takes now the UUID
                  of the related 'CremePropertyType' instance instead of its ID (see 'creme_core.models' section) ;
                  the related field 'EntityFilterCondition.name' stores now the UUID of the CremePropertyType instance.
                  The attribute "_ptype_id" has been replaced by "_ptype_uuid".
            - The class 'paginator.FlowPaginator' does not accept ForeignKeys as key anymore;
              pass the corresponding "low-level" attribute (e.g. "user_id") or a sub-field (e.g. "user__username").
            - In the class 'reminder.Reminder' :
                - These methods have been removed : get_emails(), generate_email_subject(), generate_email_body(), send_mails().
                - You have now to implement the methods 'get_users()' & 'get_notification_content()'.
                - In the method 'execute()' the argument "job" has been removed.
            - In the method 'search.Searcher.search()', the argument "research" has been renamed "searched".
        # In 'creme_core.models' :
            - The model 'CremePropertyType' uses now a classical AutoField (i.e. integers) for primary key, and gets an UUIDField.
              A CharField "app_label" has been added too (the app label was given is the previous string primary key).
              The parameters of the method 'CremePropertyTypeManager.smart_update_or_create()' have changed ;
              "str_pk" & "generate_pk" have been replaced bu "uuid". Notice that this method is now mainly useful to set the ContentType constraints
              (because you can pass model, not only ContentType instances) ; use 'CremePropertyType.objects.create()' or
              'CremePropertyType.objects.update_or_create()' in the other cases.
            - In 'bricks' :
                - The model 'CustomBrickConfigItem' uses now a classical AutoField (i.e. integers) for primary key,
                  and gets an UUIDField. In your "populate.py" scripts, you should probably set the "uuid" with a
                  hard-coded value (but you can just let the code generate a value).
                - The properties 'brick_id' of the models 'CustomBrickConfigItem'/'InstanceBrickConfigItem'/'RelationBrickItem'
                  return different values (the prefixes contained in the attributes '_brick_id_prefix' have changed).
                  Idem with 'InstanceBrickConfigItem.generate_base_id()'.
                     - "rtype_brick" => "rtype"
                     - "instanceblock" => "instance"
                     - "customblock" => "custom"
                  The methods 'id_from_brick_id()' have been removed.
                - The method 'SpecificRelationsBrick.generate_id()' has been removed (it was unused/useless since Creme 2.4).
            - The field 'HeaderFilter.json_cells' is now a 'JSONField';
              you won't have to change your code if you use the property 'cells' as advised.
            - The field 'EntityFilter.filter_type' is now a CharField (see changes about the constants 'EF_*').
            - In 'EntityFilterCondition' :
                - The field 'name' contains now the UUID of 'CremePropertyType' & 'CustomField' when it's relevant.
                - The field 'raw_value' has been renamed "value" & is now a 'JSONField';
                  it'll only affect direct access to the field (e.g. QuerySet), because the property (getter/setter) "value" has just been replaced.
                  The JSON data should always be a dictionary, so the data changed for conditions on CremeProperties
                  (example: 'true' became '{"has":true}' ; see 'creme_core.core.entity_filter.condition_handler.PropertyConditionHandler').
                - In conditions related to 'Relation', the format of the stored JSOn has changed :
                  - The related 'ContentType' is now stored with the key "ct" (instead of "ct_id"), and the value is the natural-key (instead of the ID).
                  - The related 'CremeEntity' is now stored with the key "entity" (instead of "entity_id") and the value is the UUID (instead of the ID).
            - The method 'FieldsConfig._get_hidden_field_names()' has been replaced by the property "hidden_field_names".
            - The class attribute 'HistoryLine.ENABLED' has been removed, so reading it is broken
              (you can still set it because it is checked dynamically, but is is deprecated -- see the deprecation section).
            - The model 'reminder.DateReminder' has been removed.
        # In 'creme_core.forms' :
            - In 'entity_filter.fields' :
                - The attribute 'CustomFieldsConditionsField._non_hiddable_cfield_ids' has been replaced by "_non_hiddable_cfield_uuids".
                - The attribute 'PropertiesConditionsField._non_disabled_ptype_ids' has been replaced by "_non_disabled_ptype_uuids".
            - In 'merge', the CSS classes related to 'EntitiesHeaderWidget' & 'MergeWidget' has been renamed
              (the templates & 'creme_core/js/merge.js' have been reworked of course) :
                - "merge_entity_field" => "merge-field".
                - "li_merge_entity_header*" => "merge-field-header-*".
                - "li_merge_result_header" => "merge-field-header-result".
                - "li_merge_entity*" => "merge-field-*".
                - "li_merge_result" => "merge-field-result".
                - "li_merge_button" => "merge-field-button".
        # In 'creme_core.gui' :
            - The attribute 'listview.state.ListViewState.extra_q' has been removed.
            - The method 'mass_import.FormRegistry.register()' now raises an exception when a model is registered twice.
        # The behaviour of the method 'creme_core.utils.meta.FieldInfo.value_from()' has changed with "low-level" attributes
          related to ForeignKeys; now it return the low-level value (e.g. integer, string...), not the related model instance anymore.
          Example: 'FieldInfo(Contact, 'user_id').value_from(my_contact)' returns an integer, not a CremeUser instance.
                   'FieldInfo(Contact, 'user').value_from(my_contact)' still returns a CremeUser instance.
        # In 'creme_core.views' :
            - In 'bricks' :
                - The attribute 'BricksReloading.check_bricks_permission' has been removed (in child classes too).
                - The default value attribute 'BrickStateSetting.brick_id_arg' changed from "id" to "brick_id".
                  So you'll have to fix your JavaScript code if you use the URL named "creme_core__set_brick_state".
            - In 'creme_property', the brick IDs have been simplified.
              The method 'TaggedEntitiesBrick.parse_brick_id()' has been reworked in consequence.
            - In 'search' :
                - The global variable 'MIN_RESEARCH_LENGTH' has been renamed 'MIN_SEARCH_LENGTH'.
                - In the class 'FoundEntitiesBrick' :
                    - The value of the attribute "id" have been simplified.
                      The method 'parse_brick_id()' has been reworked in consequence.
                    - The constructor argument and attribute 'research' have been rename 'searched'.
                - In the class-view 'Search', teh context variable "research" has been renamed "searched".
                  The related template  "creme_core/search_results.html" has been reworked of course.
        # In 'creme_core.tests' :
            - The method 'base._CremeTestCase.get_propertytype_or_fail()' now takes an UUID string instead of an integer.
            - In the method 'base._CremeTestCase.get_relationtype_or_fail()',
              the arguments "sub_props" & "obj_props" are now iterable of <CremePropertyTypes or strings> (instead of integers).
            - The method 'views.base.ButtonTestCaseMixin.iter_instance_button_nodes()' has been renamed 'iter_button_nodes()'
              (because of the new method 'get_global_buttons_node()').
        # The template "creme_core/templates/creme_core/view_property_type.html" is now "creme_core/templates/creme_core/detail/property-type.html".
        # These obsolete JavaScript tools have been removed (because all browsers are supporting flexbox, table layout and ResizeObserver) :
            - creme.widget.Container
            - creme.layout.LayoutResizeSensor
        # Some icons which were unused (& not in the 2 themes) were moved in "creme/media/warehouse/" : pin.svg, print.svg, buyer.svg, training.svg...
          They are not collected by the asset manager anymore, but you can copy them in your project to use them.
        # Apps :
            * Creme_config :
                - In 'registry._ConfigRegistry' :
                    - The way the bricks of portal & app portals are managed have changed.
                      BEWARE: when you register a brick with 'register_portal_bricks()'/'register_app_bricks()' (in your 'apps.py'),
                      the brick class must not be registered in the global brick registry anymore.
                    - The way the bricks of "My settings" are managed have changed :
                        - BEWARE: when you register a brick with 'register_user_bricks()' (in your 'apps.py'),
                          the brick class must not be registered in the global brick registry anymore.
                        - The property 'user_bricks' has been replaced by 'get_user_bricks()'.
                - In 'urls' :
                    - The view named 'creme_config__create_detailviews_bricks' has been renamed 'creme_config__create_detailview_bricks'.
                    - The view named 'creme_config__delete_home_brick' has been renamed 'creme_config__delete_home_bricks'.
                - In 'forms' :
                    - The class 'bricks._CustomBrickConfigItemBaseForm' has been removed.
                    - In 'creme_property_type', these classes have been removed :
                        - _CremePropertyTypeBaseForm
                        - CremePropertyTypeCreationForm
                        - CremePropertyTypeEditionForm
                    - The global dictionary 'forms.setting._FIELDS' has been removed;
                      see the new class attribute 'creme_core.core.setting_key._SettingKey.FORM_FIELDS' instead.
                - The class-view 'views.user_settings.UserSettings' does not inject "apps_usersettings_bricks" in the context anymore.
                - The template 'user_settings.html' has been renamed 'user-settings.html' to be more consistent.
            * Persons :
                - The UUIDs of the instances of the models 'Civility', 'Position', 'Sector', 'LegalForm' & 'StaffSize'
                  created by the 'populate' script are now fixed (to be consistent between Creme instances).
                  A data migration fixes the UUIDs of the 5 types provided by default, and stores the old UUIDs in their field "meta_data".
                - In the method 'models.Address.info_field_names()' (used by several form generators for Address),
                  the excluded fields are just not-viewable fields (it was a hard coded list before).
                - The hat-card bricks have been reworked to facilitate the modification of small summaries (activities, acts, opportunities).
                  A base class 'CardSummary' has been introduced. The classes 'ContactCardHatBrick' & 'OrganisationCardHatBrick' get
                  new attributes "intro_summary" & "summaries"; so its easier to change summaries from external code (the dependencies of the bricks
                  are automatically computed, summaries indicate which template to use etc...).
                    - The class 'Activities4Card' has been replaced by 'LastActivityIntroSummary' & 'NextActivitySummary'.
                    - The class 'Opportunities4Card' has been replaced by 'OpportunitiesSummary'.
                    - The class 'CommercialActs4Card' has been replaced by 'CommercialActsSummary'.
                  The related templates have changed :
                    - "persons/bricks/*-hat-card.html"
                    - "persons/bricks/frags/card-*.html"
                - In the class 'buttons.CrmButton' (& in the child classes), the attribute 'relation_type_id' has been removed
                  (the new attribute 'Button.relation_type_deps' is used instead).
            * Activities :
                - The models 'ActivityType' & 'ActivitySubType' use now regular 'AutoField' (i.e. integer) for primary key,
                  & get an 'UUIDField' (they used custom 'CharField' as primary key).
                  The constant strings which allow to retrieve types by their ID have been replaced by constants UUID:
                    e.g. use 'UUID_TYPE_MEETING' instead of 'ACTIVITYTYPE_MEETING'.
                  Hint: see the files "migrations/002?_v2_6__types_uuid0?.py" to understand how to write your own migrations if you reference these types in your own models.
                - The UUIDs of the instances of 'models.Status' created by the 'populate' script are now fixed (to be consistent between Creme instances).
                    - The constants 'STATUS_*' have been removed; you should use the new constants 'UUID_STATUS_*' instead.
                    - A data migration fixes the UUIDs of the 5 Statuses provided by default, and stores the old UUIDs in their field "meta_data".
                - The method 'forms.fields.ParticipatingUsersField.clean()' now returns a dictionary containing the concerned Contacts & Calendars ;
                  the forms manipulating participants have slightly changed their internal behaviour, beware if you inherit them.
                - The brick 'bricks.UserCalendarsBrick' does not inject "has_app_perm" in its context anymore.
                - The class 'buttons.AddRelatedActivityButton' has been reworked to use 'ActivityType.uuid';
                  e.g. the class attribute "activity_type" has been replaced by "activity_type_uuid".
                - In 'views' :
                    - In 'activity', the class-view 'ActivityCreation' has been reworked to use 'ActivityType.uuid';
                      e.g. the method 'get_type_id()' has been replaced by 'get_type_uuid()'.
                      Notice that the GET argument to fix the type must be a UUID now (if you use these URLS in your template for example).
                    - In 'calendar', the function '_js_timestamp_to_datetime' has been removed and replaced by 'fromRFC3339()' & 'toRFC3339()'.
                - The class 'statistics.AveragePerMonthStatistics' has been reworked to use 'ActivityType.uuid';
                  e.g. in the class attribute 'items', the keys "type_id" have been replaced by "type_uuid".
                - The upgrade of 'FullCalendar' caused some changes :
                    - 'creme.activities.CalendarController' has been renamed as 'creme.ActivityCalendar'.
                    - The Calendar view changes are now stored in URL hashes (e.g: #week & #month).
                    - We use ISO8601 format WITH timezone for queries on backend views (e.g. "2023-04-14T10:38:30+01:00").
            * Assistants :
                - The module 'creme_jobs' has been removed (_UserMessagesSendType etc...).
                - In the model 'UserMessage', the field 'email_sent' & the method 'send_mails()' have been removed.

                - The UUIDs of the instances of 'models.UserMessagePriority' created by the 'populate' script are now fixed (to be consistent between Creme instances).
                    - The constants 'PRIO_*' & 'USERMESSAGE_PRIORITIES' have been removed; you should use the new constants 'UUID_PRIORITY_*' instead.
                    - A data migration fixes the UUIDs of the 3 Priorities provided by default, and stores the old UUIDs in their field "meta_data".
            * Documents :
                - In the context of the brick 'ChildFoldersBrick', "folder_model" is not injected anymore.
            * Products :
                - The UUIDs of the instances of the models 'Category' & 'SubCategory' created by the 'populate' script are now fixed (to be consistent between Creme instances).
                  A data migration fixes the UUIDs of the instances provided by default, and stores the old UUIDs in their field "meta_data".
            * Billing :
                - In 'constants' :
                    - 'DEFAULT_DRAFT_INVOICE_STATUS' has been removed (use 'InvoiceStatus.is_default' instead).
                    - 'DEFAULT_INVOICE_STATUS' has been removed (use 'InvoiceStatus.is_validated' instead).
                - In 'views.base', in the class-views 'BaseCreation' & 'RelatedBaseCreation' (& so, in their child classes),
                  the attribute 'initial_status' has been removed.
                - The method 'populate.Populator.create_reports()' has been replaced by a new one, '_populate_reports()'.
                - The UUIDs of the instances of the models '*Status', 'PaymentTerms', 'SettlementTerms' & 'AdditionalInformation'
                  created by the 'populate' script are now fixed (to be consistent between Creme instances).

                - The default value for the field 'models.Line.vat_value' is now dynamic & use the 'Vat' instance with <is_default=True> ;
                  so it will break your code which relied on an implicit "0.0" value (mainly your unit tests).
            * Opportunities :
                - The UUIDs of the instances of the models 'SalesPhase' & 'Origin' created by the 'populate' script are now fixed (to be consistent between Creme instances).
                  A data migration fixes the UUIDs of the instances provided by default, and stores the old UUIDs in their field "meta_data".
                - The class 'bricks.OpportunityCardHatBrick' (& the related template) has been reworked to follow the changes in app "persons".
                  A new class 'ContactsSummary' has been introduced, and the class variable "displayed_contacts_number" has been move into it.

                - The constructor of 'models.mail.EntityEmailSender' now takes only one argument (the 'EntityEmail' instance) ;
                  the class stored in the class attribute 'AbstractEntityEmail.email_sender_cls' uses this new signature.
                - In 'utils' :
                    - The constructor of 'EMailSender' takes now an argument "domain".

  Developers side :
  -----------------
    - The version of 'Django' is now "4.2".
      You should probably read the following releases notes for Django versions :
        - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/releases/4.0/
          Some important items :
            - The 'settings.py' value 'USE_L10N' is now deprecated.
            - The 'settings.py' value ALLOWED_HOSTS must be a list.
            - In classes inheriting 'django.template.Node', the method 'render()' must return a string.
        - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/releases/4.1/
          Some important items :
            - The method 'assertFormError()' should now take a form instance.
            - The logout view should be used with a POST request.
            - A reverse FK now raises ValueError when calling related managers for unsaved objects.
        - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/releases/4.2/
          Some important items :
             - Attributes 'index_together' of your Meta classes should be replaces by 'indexes'.
             - Beware to the argument 'update_fields' in your custom methods 'save()' for models.
    - New versions of libraries :
        - bleach 5.0 -> 6.0
        - Pillow 9.2+ -> 9.4+
        - redis: 4.1 -> 4.5
        - flake8: 5.0 -> 6.0
        - polib: 1.1 -> 1.2

    Non breaking changes :
    ----------------------
        # A new context processor 'creme.creme_core.context_processors.get_base_template' injects now
          the new settings.py variable 'BASE_HTML' (default value: "creme_core/base.html").
          All pages which extended "creme_core/base.html" have been updated to use this variable.
          So you can now customise the base structure of the pages, because your our own base template can extend "creme_core/base.html"
          (i.e. you do not have to override it with a copy-pasted version anymore).
        # In order to allow the resetting of CustomForms, the good way to describe the fresh configuration is to use the new
          class 'creme.creme_core.gui.custom_form.CustomFormDefault' & stop describing the fields in the "populate" scripts
          (so the fields are listed only once, & forms built by "populate" scripts & the resetting view will be the same).
          So, IF YOU DEFINED CUSTOMFORMS for your own models, you SHOULD :
            - create classes inheriting 'CustomFormDefault', and use them when creating your descriptors (argument "default").
            - in your 'Populator', remove the argument "groups_desc" of 'CustomFormConfigItem.objects.create_if_needed()'.
          The section "CustomForms" of the tutorials has been updated (& you can see how vanilla apps are made of course).

        # In 'creme_core.forms.enumerable' :
            - In the class 'EnumerableChoiceSet', the optional property 'url' allows to use any URL instead of only "creme_core__enumerable_choices".

        # In Javascript:
            - 'creme.form.Select2' now supports the lazy loading of selections ;
              it's useful in entity filter polymorphic inputs that do not know the selected options beforehand.
            - New 'RGBColor.rgb()' method to handle CSS format : 'rgb(int, int, int)'
        # Apps :
            * Sketch :
                - A function 'creme.d3NumericDataInfo()' which creates the following stats from data has been added :
                  min, max, only integers, value range, average.
                - The functions 'creme.d3NumericFormat()' & 'creme.d3NumericAxisFormat()' have been added to find the best format from data information.
                - A render function 'creme.d3Scroll()' has been added to handle horizontal or vertical scrolling of an SVG node.

    Internal breaking changes :
    ---------------------------
    (they should not cause problem if you have not deeply modified the source code of Creme)

        # In the class 'creme_core.gui.field_printers._FieldPrintersRegistry', the following attributes have been removed/replaced :
          _html_printers, _csv_printers, _printers_maps, _choice_printers.
        # In the class 'creme_core.templatetags.creme_cells.CellRenderNode', the class attribute 'RENDER_METHODS' has been removed.
        # Apps :
            * Emails :
                - The constant 'utils._MIME_IMG_CACHE' has been removed.


== Version 2.4 ==

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should create a all new virtual environment based on Python 3.7+ .
    - If you used the emails synchronisation in Creme2.3, you should finish to flush the list of
      untreated emails (i.e. mark them as synchronised or spam) before upgrading to Creme 2.4 .

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The users can now change their own password, and reset their lost password.
      These 2 features can be disabled in the new page "Configuration of the instance".
    # The setting 'USE_L10N' is now set to 'True' by default (previously only 'False' was working).
      So, by default, the formats for dates & times depend on the user's language.
    # The inner-edition (i.e. edition of one field directly in the detail-view) can now handles several fields at once.
      It's used for example in the relationships-blocks (the blocks displaying the entities linked by a specific relationship type)
      when you configure the fields to display: all displayed fields are edited with one form (so you avoid many clicks).
    # In the History's block, lines related to entities from apps you cannot view are excluded.
    # A periodic job which removes the deprecated users' sessions has been added.
    # The combo-boxes with autocompletion now use the JavaScript library "Select2".
      Their look'n feel has slightly changed, & for compatible models with a lot of choices, the loading & search are now done lazily.
      Almost all small auxiliary models defined in apps (ticket Status, Sector…) are compatible ; 'user' model is compatible too.
    # The old color picker 'gccolor' has been replaced by the standard HTML5 color input (less bug, less code).
    # The version of the shipped Closure compiler has been upgraded (2020-01-12 => 2022-09-05).
    # Two new variables have been added in 'settings.py' :
        - SOFTWARE_LABEL is "Creme" by default.
        - ENTITIES_DELETION_ALLOWED can disable the definitive deletion of entities.
          It's true by default (deletion is allowed), & staff user can always delete entities (to fix privacy issue for example).
    # The command "creme_start_project" has been improved to get a 'setup.py' that works
      (if you want to install your project in your virtual environment).
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - The email addresses of active users must be unique.
            - The menu icon can now be customised.
            - The menu can be customised per role.
            - The relationship types have been improved :
                - Non-internal types can now be disabled.
                - A new kind of constraints has been added : forbidden properties (on subject & object of course).
            - An edition view for semi-fixed relationship types has been added.
            - The roles can now be cloned ; you can chose to copy the configurations of bricks/menu/custom-forms/search.
            - The old password is required when changing a user's password.
            - The configurations of CustomForms are collapsed by default, & can be expanded separately.
        * Assistants :
            - The trigger date of an Alert can now be relative to a date field of the linked entity (e.g. "3 days before its birthday").
              Relative trigger dates are automatically updated when the date field changes.
            - The owner of Alerts & ToDos can now be dynamic, to always send emails to the entity's owner.
        * Activities :
            - The sub-type of Activities must now be filled.
              Notice that a migration creates sub-types for types which are used in Activities with NULL sub-type.
            - The relationships type "is subject of the activity" is now internal.
            - In creation form, when an Alert with a trigger date relative to the Activity's start is created,
              the new feature <Alert with relative trigger date> is used.
              So the trigger date is finally updated when the Activity's start is modified (a very old annoying behaviour disappears).
            - The inner-edition is now available for these fields: start, end, is_all_day, busy.
              Notice that they are always edited all together with a composite widget.
            - The iCal export has been reworked.
        * Emails :
            - The synchronisation of external emails has been totally reworked & separated from the app "crudity".
              This feature allows Creme to fetch emails from some mailboxes to potentially create true Email entities
              (e.g. you send a mail, with your usual mail client, to a customer & to the synchronisation address, then you get this mail in Creme).
                - Now the mail servers are configured with a GUI (it was in 'settings.py').
                - IMAP4 is supported (only POP3 was).
                - Mails are in a sandbox, & entities are created only when you accept them (instead of using the status "Synchronized - Untreated").
                - Attachments can be ignored, or removed before the mail is transformed into an entity.
                - ...
              BEWARE: if you used this feature in Creme 2.3, you'll have to remove the configuration
                      in your settings (it's not supported anymore) & re-create it in the GUI.
        * Reports :
            - The reports now are displaying new charts using the JavaScript library "D3js" which comes with many improvements :
                - Performance improvements (native SVG).
                - Charts are following layout changes like resizing the window.
                - No longer limited for the creation of custom charts (see 'Relationship graph' brick below).
            - The 'USE_JQPLOT' setting allows to fallback to JQplot if needed, and will be removed with the release of <Creme 2.5>.
        * Persons :
            - The Organisation's bricks "Managers" & "Employees" propose now to edit the related contacts, using the new multi-fields inner-edition feature.
        * Products :
            - In 'models', the fields 'Category.description' & 'SubCategory.description' are not mandatory anymore.
        * Billing :
            - When a Quote is converted to an Invoice, a relationship is now created between them.
        * Opportunities :
            - The bricks "Linked Contacts" & "Business managers" display now these fields for the related contacts: position, email, phone, mobile.
              They propose to edit them too, using the new multi-fields inner-edition feature.
        * Graphs :
            - A new 'Relationship graph' brick is available, displaying the graph in the detail-view without having to download an image.
              Notice it can be downloaded as image too.
        * Mobile :
            - An "owner" field is now present in forms to create Contacts & Organisations.
        * Polls :
            - The design of the 'Statistic' brick has changed.
        * Crudity :
            - The support of InfoPath files has been removed.
        * Geolocation :
            - Map markers now display more information when hovered: the actual address information. The title's importance has also been reduced,
              as it's usually less useful on a map than the address itself.

                * Reports :
                    - The template file "reports/templatetags/report_chart.html" has been removed.

        # There are 2 major changes in formats (dates, numbers) :
           - 'USE_L10N = True' by default.
           - The formats in creme/settings.py (DATE_FORMAT, DATE_INPUT_FORMATS...) have been cleared,
             so the django's values are used if you set 'USE_L10N = False'.
          So you may encounter some changes if you parse dates in your code & were relying of some specific formats.
        # In the class 'creme_core.apps.CremeAppConfig', the method 'register_sanboxes()' has been renamed 'register_sandboxes()'.
        # In 'creme_core.core.reminder.ReminderRegistry', the argument "reminder" has been renamed "reminder_class"
          in the 2 methods 'register()' & 'unregister()'.
        # The method 'creme_core.core.enumerable._EnumerableRegistry._check_model()' has been renamed "_check_is_entity()".
        # For ForeignKey fields with the ENUMERABLE tag set to 'True', the new class 'CreatorEnumerableChoiceField' is used as default formfield instead of 'CreatorModelChoiceField'.
        # In 'creme_core.forms' :
            - The module 'bulk' has been removed
              (the class 'BulkDefaultEditForm' is useless now, use 'creme_core.gui.bulk_update.FieldOverrider' instead).
            - In 'base.CremeEntityForm', the error messages with the following keys have been removed :
              "missing_property_single", "missing_property_multi".
            - In 'fields' :
                - In 'RelationEntityField' :

                  _get_cache(), _build_ctype_cache(), _build_rtype_cache().
                - The class 'ColorField' :
                     - It used 'creme_core.forms.widgets.ColorInput' instead of 'ColorPickerWidget'.
                     - It accepts the '#RRGGBB' format as input.
            - In 'widgets' :
                - The attribute 'CalendarWidget.default_help_text' is now a format string.
                - The class 'OrderedMultipleChoiceWidget' has been reworked (& its template file too) ;
                    - The input value has changed ; it's now a JSON list with selected choices.
                      So you'll have to update your unit tests for the forms using these kind of widget.
                    - The widget must now be used with the new class 'OrderedMultipleChoiceField'
                      (classical 'django.forms.OrderedMultipleChoiceField' won't work anymore).
                    - The class 'ColorPickerWidget' has been replaced by 'ColorInput'.
            - In 'listview', these methods have been removed :

            - In 'relation._RelationsCreateForm', the error messages with the following keys have been removed :
              "missing_property_single", "missing_property_multi".
        # In 'creme_core.gui' :
            - The class attribute 'button_menu.Button.id_' has been renamed "id" ;
              you have to rename this attribute in your child classes.
            - The class 'bulk_update._BulkUpdateRegistry' has been heavily reworked to manage several fields at once ;
              the inner class 'ModelBulkStatus' has been replaced by a new class '_ModelConfig', many methods have been removed...
              More important items :
                - The registration of the models is now required to get inner-edition on your entity models.
                  It means you must write in your 'apps.py' :
                    def register_bulk_update(self, bulk_update_registry):
                        bulk_update_registry.register(MyEntityModel)
                - Only models which inherit 'CremeEntity' can be registered.
                - If you excluded some fields, the new way to do is :
                    def register_bulk_update(self, bulk_update_registry):
                        bulk_update_registry.register(MyEntityModel).exclude('field1', 'field2')
                - If you customised the form for some of your fields (old argument "innerforms" of 'register()'),
                  you must use the method 'add_overriders()'. You can see examples of use in the app 'documents', 'activities', 'products' for example.
            - The method 'bricks.SpecificRelationsBrick.id_is_specific()' has been removed.
        # In 'creme_core.models' :

                - In CustomBrick's constructor, the argument "customblock_conf_item" has been renamed "custombrick_conf_item".
                - The field 'RelationBrickItem.brick' has been removed ;
                  a property is used instead, but the generated value is different.
                - The TextFields which were used to store JSON have been replaced by JSONFields :
                    - RelationBrickItem.json_cells_map
                    - InstanceBrickConfigItem.json_extra_data
                    - CustomBrickConfigItem.json_cells
                    - BrickState.json_extra_data
            - A mandatory field "object_ctype" has been added to 'Relation' ;
              but it is set automatically in 'save()' by using the value of the field 'object_entity', so your code will probably work without change.
            - A mandatory field "object_ctype" has been added to 'SemiFixedRelationType'.
            - In the models 'EntityJobResult' & 'MassImportJobResult', the new fields "entity_ctype" have to be
              filled when the field "entity" is not NULL (hint: use the new virtual field "real_entity").
            - The field 'FieldsConfig.raw_descriptions' is now a JSONField.
            - The field 'CustomFormConfigItem.json_groups' is now a JSONField.
            - A mandatory field "entity_ctype" has been added to 'Imprint'.

        # In the templatetag "menu_buttons_display" (from library "creme_menu"), the context is a fresh one for each rendered button ;
          this is the same behavior as bricks rendering for example (this is made to avoid annoying side effects).
          Be careful if you shared data between several buttons by storing them in the context during the rendering of buttons.
        # In templates :
            - In "creme/templates/authent/base.html", {% block form_username %} & {% block form_password %} have been replaced by {% block form_fields %}.
            - In "creme/creme_core/templates/creme_core/listview/content.html", {% block extra_buttons_hidden %} has been removed
              (use {% block lv_hidden_buttons %} + {{block.super}} instead).
            - The template "creme_core/frags/bulk_process_report.html" has been removed ("creme_core/bulk-update-results.html" is used instead).
        # In JavaScript :
            - The function 'creme.forms._toDualColumnMultiSelect' & 'creme.forms.toOrderedMultiSelect' have been removed ;
              the new component 'creme.widget.SelectOrInputWidget' is used instead.
            - The component 'creme.component.Chosen' is now deprecated & has been renamed as 'creme.form.Chosen'.
              It's no longer used in media generation but it still exists to ease migrations.
            - The jQuery extension 'gccolor' has been removed.
        # In 'creme_core.tests' :
            - In 'base._CremeTestCase' :
                - The method 'build_inneredit_url()' has been replaced by 'build_inneredit_uri()'.
                - The method 'build_bulkupdate_url()' has been replaced by 'build_bulkupdate_uri()'.
            - In the method 'views.base.BrickTestCaseMixin.get_brick_node()', the argument "brick_id" has been renamed "brick" ;
              it accepts now Brick classes too.

    Internal breaking changes :
    ---------------------------
    (they should not cause problem if you have not deeply modified the source code of Creme)

        # The constructor of 'creme_core.forms.entity_filter.widgets.DateFieldsConditionsWidget'
          does not take any argument "enabled" now (backported to Creme 2.3).
        # In 'creme_core.gui.last_viewed.LastViewedItem', the key "ctype_id" is now mandatory.
        # In 'creme_core.management.commands.i18n_overload.Command._get_catalog_paths()', the return
          values are now instances of 'pathlib.Path'.
        # In 'creme_core.templatetags.creme_core_tags', the implementation of "print_field" has changed.
        # In Javascript :
            - 'creme.widget.DynamicSelect' is using the new wrapper 'creme.form.Select2' instead of 'creme.form.Chosen'.
        # Apps :
            * Creme_config :
                - The class 'views.custom_form.CustomFormBrickDeletion' has been renamed "CustomFormDeletion".
            * Billing :

== Version 2.3 ==

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should create a all new virtual environment based on Python 3.6+
      (e.g. "mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3XX" if you use 'mkvirtualenv')
      and populate it with "pip install -e .[mysql|pgsql]" of course.
    - The layout of Creme projects has changed : Creme is a classical Python package
      installed in your virtualenv & your own data are stored in another place.
      Create a fresh project folder with the following command (you must be out of the Creme's tree):
          > creme creme_start_project my_project
    - Edit the file "my_project/settings.py" ;
      copy (carefully) the values from your old files "local_settings.py/project_settings.py".
        - Do not forget to set the values for LANGUAGE_CODE & TIME_ZONE (the default
          values in Creme 2.2 are 'fr' & 'Europe/Paris' ; if you did not set them
          in your instance of Creme 2.2, use these values explicitly with Creme 2.3).
        - The hard-coded sub-folder 'upload/' has been moved to the default value of 'settings.MEDIA_ROOT' ;
          so if you have set 'MEDIA_ROOT' in your personal settings, add a sub-folder "upload" at the end
          (to avoid breaking the paths of all your uploaded Documents, generated PDFs etc...).
          Example:
            > MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join('var', 'www', 'example.com', 'media')
            becomes
            > MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join('var', 'www', 'example.com', 'media', 'upload')
        - The value of 'settings.GENERATED_MEDIA_DIR' is not used anymore ; 'settings.STATIC_ROOT' is used instead.
          So if you have set 'GENERATED_MEDIA_DIR' in your personal settings, rename it "STATIC_ROOT".
          Example:
            > GENERATED_MEDIA_DIR = os.path.join('var', 'www', 'example.com', 'static')
            becomes
            > STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join('var', 'www', 'example.com', 'static')
    - If your old setting MEDIA_ROOT had the default value ("creme/media/"), copy the content of the
      folder "creme/media/upload/" of your old installation to the destination indicated by your new
      setting MEDIA_ROOT ("my_project/media/upload/" by default in the generated file "my_project/settings.py").
      If your old setting MEDIA_ROOT referenced a folder out of the default, you can just
      make a backup of these uploaded files (backups are a good thing).
    - Execute the well known commands "migrate", "creme_populate" & "generatemedia", but in a new way:
        > creme migrate --settings=my_project.settings
        > creme creme_populate --settings=my_project.settings
        > creme generatemedia --settings=my_project.settings
    - The undocumented options "colorize" & "colors" of 'creme.utils.loggers.CremeFormatter' have been removed ;
      fix your settings if you used it (probably not).
    - If you used the locale overloading (generated by the command "i18n_overload.py")
        - Copy the content of the old folder "creme/locale_overload/locale/" in a new
          folder "my_project/locale_overload/" (beware there is no "locale/" sub-folder).
        - In your project's settings, add the line:
            > LOCALE_PATHS.insert(0, BASE_DIR / 'locale_overload')

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The version of Django has been upgraded to "3.2".
    # The layout of Creme projects has changed : now Creme lives as a classical Python package
      in your virtualenv, and your settings/media are well separated from Creme's code
      (see the new command "creme_start_project").
    # Two full-python backends for the media-generator have been added ;
      they are used in the default configuration (see the setting 'ROOT_MEDIA_FILTERS') in order to remove the dependency to Java by default.
        - The package "csscompressor" is used to minify the CSS files.
        - The package "rjsmin" is used to minify the JavaScript files.
    # The history has been improved :
        - The messages in the history block are prettier.
        - Old & new values are stored now for TextFields (e.g. description) ; they are shown in a popover dialog.
        - Elements which are added & removed for ManyToManyFields are now stored.
        - CustomFields are now historized too.
    # The global search can now search in CustomFields.
    # The job scheduler can now use a UNIX socket (when they are available) to
      communicate with the views, instead of a Redis server.
    # Many blocks got descriptions, which are displayed as tool-tips.
    # The field "modified" of entities is updated when you use inner/bulk edition with a CustomField.
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - The main menu can now be customised ; containers can be created,
              re-ordered, removed, & their entries can be chosen too.
              All apps have been reworked to use the new system to provide a menu identical to the old one.
            - You can add a configuration of a Custom-Form specific to a role.
            - The fields can now be marked as required in fields' configuration (not ManyToManyFields for now).
            - The instances of CremePropertyTypes can now be disabled (to not be proposed in forms).
            - The configuration form for blocks on detailed views has been redesigned
              (the pool of available blocks is now shared, blocks are draggable, descriptions are displayed).
            - A portal which displays all the filters (used by list-views) has been added.
            - A portal which displays all the views (of list-views) has been added.
        * Persons :
            - A many-to-many field "Spoken language(s)" has been added to Contacts ; it's hidden for old installations.
            - The setting PERSONS_MENU_CUSTOMERS_ENABLED has been removed (you can add/remove the entry menu in 'creme_config').
        * Billing :
            - The field 'payment_type' ("Settlement terms") is now present in all 'billing' entity types (Quote, SalesOrder...).
              Notice that if you upgrade your Creme installation, if you want to display this field in the detail-views, you
              have to edit your block configuration (excepted for 'Invoice' of course).
        * Reports :
            - The CustomFields with type DATE can now be used as abscissa in ReportGraphs (only DATETIME was available).
        * Emails :
            - When you create an email from a detailed view, only one of the 2 bodies needs to be filled
              (the other one is automatically filled from it).
        * Assistants :
            - In Alerts & ToDos bricks, the validated lines can be shown/hidden. The default behaviour is still the same.

== Version 2.2 ==

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should create a all new virtual environment based on Python 3.6+
      (e.g. "mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3XX" if you use 'mkvirtualenv')
      and populate it with "pip install -e .[mysql|pgsql]" of course.
    - Execute the well known commands "migrate", "generatemedia" & "creme_populate".
    - If you used CommercialApproaches, edit the configuration of Activities' custom-forms to add
      the field "Is a commercial approach?".

  Users side :
  ------------
    # A CustomForm system have been created : the forms for almost all entity types can be customised through
      a GUI in the general configuration. You can create groups of fields, chose which fields are used (some
      of them are required anyway) and their order. A basic layout system for the group allows you to display
      groups on the whole width, or on the half width (left or right).
    # CustomFields have been improved :
        - 3 new types of CustomFields have benn added : TEXT, DATE & URL.
        - New choices for ENUM (Choice list) & MULTI_ENUM (Multiple choice list) CustomFields can be created on-the-go in forms.
        - In mass import, duplicates choices are managed : no error is raised, the first choice is used.
    # Add a new secured view to download dynamic files (i.e. uploaded files, files related to entity, files generated by export...).
    # Sending an entity to the trash (or restoring it) creates now a history line.
    # An exception handler for errors 400 (Bad Request) has been added.
    # In listviews, the popup which displays the selected entity filter information is replaced by a popover.
    # The buttons got descriptions, which are displayed as tool-tips.
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - Each user can now fix the language to use in the interface ; by default the language asked by the browser is used (like before).
            - The possibility to export & import some configured models has been added.
              It's useful to deploy a test/prototype server, & re-use their data on the production server.
              The transferred models are : UserRoles, HeaderFilters, EntityFilters, CustomForms configuration,
              CremePropertyTypes, RelationTypes, Bricks configuration, Buttons configuration, Search configuration.
            - The configuration of CustomFields has been improved :
                - CustomFields can now be marked as required.
                - CustomFields which are related to values cannot be deleted any more; they are just marked as deleted.
                  Marked CustomFields do not appear in list-views, reports etc...
                  If a marked CustomField has no value any more (i.e. no entity uses it), it can be definitely deleted.
                - The management of choices for CustomFields (so with type ENUM or MULTI_ENUM) has been improved :
                    - A new view to manage them will improve the managing of great number of choices.
                    - The deletion view proposes now to replace a choice by another one in related entities.
                    - Duplicated choices are now avoided when creating or editing choices.
            - The deletion/replacement of UserRoles uses now the "deletor" Job.
            - A popover is used for permissions by filter in the role configuration.
            - In the configuration of bricks :
                - The constraints of InstanceBricks are displayed.
                - It's now forbidden to delete a RelationType brick, a custom brick or an instance brick when it is used in a configuration.
        * Reports :
            - In Reports, the aggregates related to hidden field are hidden too.
            - The way the abscissa & the ordinate of 'models.AbstractReportGraph' are stored has been rework.
            - The ReportGraph's form has been improved too :
                - The fields for abscissa & ordinate have been replaced by 2 composite/chained fields.
                - The new widget for abscissa does not perform AJAX requests & has autocompletion.
            - A new ReportGraph fetcher specific to Contact has been added : "belongs to the Contact/User".
            - The volatile link is now used to narrow the related list-view (when you click of a ReportGraph's brick).
            - The report graph bricks set now the compatible entities types (attribute "target_ctypes") ;
              so they are only proposed for detail-view's brick configuration which are relevant.
        * Billing :
            - A backend system to export documents as files replaces the old PDF export (based on LateX) ;
              Several backends have been created, based on: xhtml2pdf, weasyprint, xlwt (python packages) & pdflatex (external binary, like before).
              All these backends export PDF files, excepted the one based on 'xlwt' which exports raw data in XLS files.
              In the default settings, the one based on 'xhtml2pdf' & 'xlwt' are activated ; there are easy to install with "pip", even on Windows, & give good results.
              The 2 "new" PDF exporters ('xhtml2pdf' & 'weasyprint') got new visual design.
              If you were using LateX in previous releases, configure your setting 'BILLING_EXPORTERS', & then select it in the configuration GUI of 'billing'.
        * Activities :
            - The version of Fullcalendar has been upgraded (from "1.6.7" to "3.10").
            - The creation/edition of events through a range selection is now possible in the calendar.
        * Persons :
            - The constraints of the RelationTypes "owns => belongs to" have been narrowed to: [Contact, Organisation] => Organisation.
        * Tickets :
            - A field 'Status.is_closed' has been added ; it can be edited in configuration.
        * Commercial :
            - The constraints of some RelationTypes have been narrowed :
                - "has sold => has been sold by" : [Contact, Organisation] => [Product, Service].
                - with "completes a goal of the commercial action", this types cannot be subject any more :
                  Strategy, billing.{CreditNote, TemplateBase, ProductLine, ServiceLine}
        * Projects :
            - The fields "start" & "end" of Tasks cannot be emptied with the inner-edition any more.
              BEWARE: if you have empty values, they are replaced at migration (<0> for duration, <01-01-1970> for start/end).
        * Geolocation :
            - An OpenStreetMap backend and 3 related bricks have been added :
                 - OpenStreetMapDetailMapBrick
                 - OpenStreetMapFilteredMapBrick
                 - OpenStreetMapNeighboursMapBrick
        * Mobile :
            - A new SettingKey to configure the redirection links to "Google Maps" or "Open Street Map" has been added. Some examples :
                 - https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query={search}
                 - https://www.openstreetmap.org#map=18/{lat}/{lng}

== Version 2.1 ==

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should create a all new virtual environment based on Python 3.5+
      (e.g. "mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3XX" if you use 'mkvirtualenv')
      and populate it with "pip install -r creme/requirements.txt" of course.
    - If you override INSTALLED_DJANGO_APPS in you local settings, you should replace "django.contrib.contenttypes" by "creme.creme_core.apps.ContentTypesConfig" (see settings.py).
    - Execute the well known commands "migrate", "generatemedia" & "creme_populate".

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The version of Django has been upgraded to 2.2.
    # A field "description" has been added to CremeEntity. Data has been migrated for entities classes which already had this field, of course.
    # The credentials system has been improved :
        - The credentials can now be configured to forbid some actions.
          E.g. if you want a user to see all kinds of entities excepted one, you are not obliged to create all-minus-one credentials lines ; you can just allow all of types of entities & forbid this one.
        - The credentials can now use an EntityFilter.
            - These filters can check: regular-fields (not date ones), custom-field (not date ones), relationships, properties.
            - These filters can be specific to a type on entities ; when there is no specific type
                - Only regular-fields of CremeEntity are available (i.e. user & description).
                - Custom-fields are not available.
            - These filters remain related to the credentials, & cannot be selected in list-views for example.
    # In the list-views :
        - The quick-search on numeric (integer/float/decimal) fields (regular & custom) has been improved : complex filter like ">100; <=250" can be used.
        - The selector of HeaderFilter now uses <optgroup> to group views by owner.
        - A description of the filter can be displayed (so you can see the conditions without editing the filter).
    # In the forms :
        - Most of the form for entities have now fields to add Relationships & Properties at creation.
          The setting "FORMS_RELATION_FIELDS" can be set to False to remove these new fields.
        - The inactive users are now in a specific <optgroup> in the "Owner" form-field.
    # In the global search, the searched string is split in words, which can be contained in different fields. Words can be grouped with " (double quote). Double quotes can be searched with \" .
    # The blocks configuration of "Home" can now be specific to a role.
    # The inner-edition in hat-card bricks is now possible.
    # A setting to initialize the field 'is_private' of creation forms for HeaderFilters & EntityFilters has ben added: "FILTERS_INITIAL_PRIVATE".
    # The file "requirements.txt" has been split for different RDBMS.
    # A command to create staff users has been added : "creme_createstaffuser".
      Previously you had to modify manually (in DB or with Python code) the field 'is_staff'.
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - The deletion of instance has been improved.
              The removing of an instance (of a registered model) uses now a form which proposes a replacement value for the different kind of entities using it.
              The replacement is then processed by a job.
            - In the block to configure Users, inactive users can be hidden (from the block menu in its header).
        * Persons :
            - A view to create "suspect/prospects/customer" has been added.
            - A new quick-search field for Address has been added. It searches in all (not-hidden) fields of the related addresses.
            - A setting to hide the entry "My customers / prospects / suspects" in the main menu has been added : "PERSONS_MENU_CUSTOMERS_ENABLED".
        * Activities :
            - The calendar view has been improved :
                - Selected Calendars are kept in session.
                - Users are ordered alphabetically.
                - Inactive & staff users are excluded from the users list.
            - A default public calendar is now created when a user (not a staff one) is created.
              The old behaviour can be set with "ACTIVITIES_DEFAULT_CALENDAR_IS_PUBLIC = None" in your file '{local,project}_settings.py'.
        * Billing :
            - A field has been added in 'Invoice' : number of buyer's order. It's required by the french legislation.
            - The buttons (in button bar) to create related Quote/Invoice/... redirects now to the new entity's detail-view.
              The old behaviour (i.e. staying on the Contact/Organisaton's detail-view) can be restored in the billing's configuration portal.
        * Opportunities :
            - The statuses of the billing documents are now displayed in the bricks of the detail-view.
            - Two SettingKeys which add constraints on selected billing documents to link have been added : same emitter & same target than the Opportunity.
            - The hat-card brick now only displays a maximum of 5 related Contacts.
        * Reports :
            - The chart's type and the order of a ReportGraph are saved when changed from the preview on a block.
            - The description of the filter used by a Report can be seen in the list-view & the detail-view.
        * Assistants :
            - The FunctionFields have now the quick-search feature (to search related Alerts/ToDos/Memos from the list-views).
        * Graphs :
            - The module "pygraphviz" has been removed from the main 'requirements.txt'. The "download PNG" button is displayed only if the package is installed.
        * Events :
            - The buttons of the related contacts list-view have been improved.
                - A button "Back to the event" has been added.
                - Some buttons have been removed :
                    - Mass import (imported contacts won't be linked to the event automatically which is confusing).
                    - Batch process (process contacts won't be filtered to be linked to the event).
                    - Export header (because it's mostly useful for mass import).

  Developers side :
  -----------------
      In this version, there are 3 main changes for developers :
        - The version of Django is now "2.2".
          You should probably read the following releases notes for Django versions :
            - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/releases/2.0/
            - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/releases/2.1/
            - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/releases/2.2/
        - The work on class-based views continues ; lots ot new function-views have been converted, but the biggest
          changes happened for list-views.
          The compatibility with function-views is totally broken, but migrating the code of your own list-views should be easy in most cases.
          This new class-based list-view is more stronger ; for example you can now easily customise the buttons & the actions.
        - The way the registration in 'creme_config' is done has heavily changed.
          Now a method in the files "apps.py" is used instead of the files "creme_config_register.py".
          Lot of things can now be configured about a model :
            - The forms for creation & edition can now be different ; the deletion form can be customised now.
            - The creation, edition & deletion URLs can be customised.
            - The creation, edition & deletion can be disabled.
            - The Brick used to display its instances can be customised.

      Other important changes:
        - The code related to EntityFilters have been heavily reworked (but it won't be a problem if you did not modified it) :
            - A lot of code from 'creme_core.models.EntityFilterCondition' has moved to a new package : 'creme_core.core.entity_filter'.
            - The code of the forms has notably been split (fields/widgets/forms).
            - A new registry has been created to register handlers (which contain the behaviour code which was in 'EntityFilterCondition') & operands (new name for 'EntityFilterVariable').
        -  The code of the search in list-views has been massively reworked.
           The old code was monolithic ; the new one is more extensible & customisable : it is separated in form/fields/widgets (like regular forms, plus some specialization).
           A tree-registry has been created in order to easily customise the search-fields used for each column of the list-views
           (see 'AppConfig.register_search_fields()' & 'creme_core.gui.listview.search.search_field_registry').

  Developers side :
  -----------------
      In this version, there are 2 main changes for developers :
        - We now use <Python 3.5> instead of <Python 2.7>.
          You can find the complete release notes of Python versions here :
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.1.html
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html
          The code has not been fixed to "just work" ; lots of changes have been done to be more consistent.
          For example, several methods called 'itervalues()' have been deprecated because their name was referencing the old dictionary API.
          Lots of <%s-format> string have been converted to <{}-format">.
        - Views are going to class :
            - Almost all generic views of 'creme_core' are now class-based (but not list-views yet) ; the generic function-views are now deprecated.
              All apps have been updated to use these new classes ; the function-views using old generic views have been deprecated (or sometimes removed).
            - Lots of function-based views have been converted.
           NB: removed functions are indicated in this changelog ; for the deprecated ones there are warnings.

      Other important changes:
        - The list-view action (for single & bulk actions) system has been totally reworked (Python & JavaScript sides).
          Actions are now classes inheriting 'creme_core.gui.actions.UIAction', & are registered with 'CremeAppConfig.register_actions()' in your 'apps.py'.
          So it's easier to add/override/remove them from another app.
        - The registration of FunctionFields has been reworked. It's now external to the models (done in files 'apps.py' with 'CremeAppConfig.register_function_fields()') ;
          so it's easier to add/override/remove them from another app.
        - A new module, 'creme_core.core.enumerable', allows to retrieve & customise the choices related to a model-field.
          It's used by list-views, filter form or ReportGraph.
        - The old popup system is almost ready to be removed ; it's now only used by list-views & deprecated generic views ;
          beware to use the new templates for popup when you use the new generic class-based views for popup
          (if you don't set the attribute "template_name", the default value will be OK).
        - The "qfilter" argument for list-view uses a new format, more powerful than the old one.
          It's a true serialization of Q objects ; so 'OR' combinations can be used for example (only 'AND' were possible with the old format).

        # A new hint, indicating when a swapped URL has never been defined, has been added (see 'creme.creme_core.conf.urls.Swappable') ;
          it could "break" an existing application (because the code stops on a fatal error at starting), but it would indicate an existing bug.
        # The model 'creme_core.models.Relation' now explicitly avoids duplicates.
          A new manager has been added, with 3 methods to handle this smoothly: safe_create(), safe_get_or_create() & safe_multi_save()
        # A new models field has been created : EntityCTypeForeignKey.
          It looks like a GenericForeignKey, but it references only CremeEntities ; it uses a true ForeignKey for the entities, so it's possible to use classical filtering on FKs.
        # A specific manager has ben added to 'creme_core.models.SettingValue', with a method which keeps retrieved instances in a (per-request) cache.
        # A generic view to help the disabling of a URL has been added : the class-based view 'creme_core.views.generic.placeholder.ErrorView'.
        # A new collection has been added : 'creme_core.utils.collections.InheritedDataChain'.
          It facilitates the writing of registries by models when data from parent classes are used too.
        # Two templatetags to store safely JSON data have been added : {% jsondata %} & {% blockjsondata %}.
        # A simple HTTP server has been added in unit tests to serve static files.
        # The command "i18n_empty" has been improved :
            - The context is now used.
              For example, an empty entry with a context is not ignored because an entry with he same 'msgid' (but without context) is filled.
            - The line numbers in the PO files are now displayed.

        # Django 1.11 raises UnorderedObjectListWarning warnings when the pagination is made on a unordered queryset ; some models were missing a Meta.ordering.
        # A model FileRef has been added ; it provides a way to remove an old bug with deletion of model referencing files.
          The related files were automatically delete when instances were deleted, so it caused problems when the DB deletion was rollbacked.
          Now a FileRef, which references the file, is created at deletion (so it's creation is cancelled on a rollback) and the new file cleaner Job will delete these FileRef instance (& the related file).
          FileRef will be useful in the future for files created dynamically (like in export views).
        # Some template filters have been added in 'creme_core_tags' : lt, lte, gt, gte, eq.
        # The test runner now creates a mock/temporary 'settings.MEDIA_ROOT' directory. So the files created in unit tests (e.g. uploaded files) are not spoiling the real 'upload/' directory.
          This temporary directory is removed at the end of tests ; there is no need to take care about deleting only the tests files any more.
        # In JavaScript :
            - The option "validator" in 'creme.dialog.FormDialog' now accepts the value "innerpopup" to continue to handle old-styled-popup HTML (<div class="in-popup" ...>)

        # Changes caused by Django 1.9 :
            - If a 'simple_tag' returns HTML, the result will be escaped if it is not mark_safe()'ed. The best way is to use 'format_html()' & 'format_html_join()' (the result is escaped, so marked as safe).
            - In templates, using _() on a classical-format string (with "%s") does not work like before, & should be avoided (because it returns a string with "%%s").
              The new way is to use {% trans %}/{% blocktrans %}, & regenerate the related PO files
              (notice that in the .po file, 'msgid/msgstr' will use "%%s", but the string returned by 'gettext()' will contain a simple "%s").
            - CharFields in forms strip their content by default.
            - The import of some models is done later (ie import in function code, not module root).
            - If you create your own model field inheriting ForeignKey/OneToOneField, you cannot set a model during migration for 'to' attribute.
            - If you import the module 'creme_config.registry', the import should be done after all the app configs are ready (e.g. importing within a view function) in order to avoid errors.
            - Django 1.9 does not like '/' at the beginning of URL regex (it says it's useless, but it can be useful in some rare cases).
            - The MIMEtype of email attachments is now set.
        # Changes caused by Django 1.10 :
            - The method 'Command.execute()' will crash if all arguments do not receive a value (use 'django.core.management.call_command()' instead).
            - The variable 'django.utils.http.PROTOCOL_TO_PORT' has been removed (seems not documented).
        # Changes caused by Django 1.11 :
            - The rendering of form-widgets has changed ; the compatibility with existing 'render()' methods does not always work.
              So you should use the new template-based system instead (it's what have been done in Creme -- see below).
            - The method 'Widget.format_output()' has been removed (a custom widget template should be used instead).
            - The arguments of 'creme_core.forms.bulk.BulkFieldSelectWidget.build_attrs()' have changed to follow the Django 1.11 signature.
            - In unit tests, (fake) emails are not sent when the recipient is empty anymore.
        # Most of libraries have been upgraded :
            - 'bleach' 1.4.X => 2.1.X.

            - 'xlwt' 1.0.X => 1.3.X.

        # In settings :
            - 'MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES' has been removed & replaced by 'MIDDLEWARE'.
            - The default settings 'LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL' & 'LOGIN_URL' use now named URLs.
            - The setting 'LOGOUT_URL' has been removed, because Django (1.10) removed it too (it was unused anyway).
            - The settings which were tuples are now lists (like in Django 1.9 global_settings), excepted 'COPY_MEDIA_FILETYPES' which is now a 'set'.
            - The middleware "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware" has been added in the default configuration ; it probably won't be a problem excepted on very specific install.
            - Beware 'formtools' has been added in 'INSTALLED_DJANGO_APPS'.
            - The logging configuration have slightly changed (formats of messages are different).
        # Using a method 'register_setting_key()' in a class inheriting CremeAppConfig is deprecated ; rename it 'register_setting_keys()'.
        # In views of all apps, the content-type of the response have been cleaned ; it probably does not break anything (or only unit tests).
            - In views which return JSON data with "text/javascript" as content_type, the content_type is now "application/json" (many of these views use creme_core.utils.jsonify()).
            - Lots of responses, with "text/javascript" as content_type, & which return a empty/string/HTML-fragment content,  have now  "text/html' as content_type.
              It probably only break unit tests.
        # In 'creme_core.models' :
            - The class attribute 'CremeModel._delete_files' has been removed ; override the methods _delete_stored_file()/_delete_stored_files() to customise the behaviour.
            - The field 'CremeAbstractEntity.is_actived' has been removed (so it's removed from 'CremeEntity' & 'Relation').
            - The fields "block_id" of the following models (in 'bricks') have been renamed to "brick_id" :
                BlockDetailviewLocation, BlockPortalLocation, BlockMypageLocation, RelationBlockItem, InstanceBlockConfigItem, BlockState.
            - In the method 'BlockDetailviewLocation.id_is_4_model()', the argument "block_id" is renamed "brick_id".
        # In 'creme_core.views' :
            - The view 'search.search()' injects now a variable "bricks" instead of "blocks" ;
              the related template 'creme_core/search_results.html' has changed to use "bricks".
            - In 'list_view_export.dl_listview()' (backported to 1.7.3) :
                - The GET argument "hfilter" is now mandatory (last list-view state is no longer used as fallback).
                - The attribute "extra_q" of the list-view state is not read any more ; the GET argument "extra_q" is used instead.
            - The view 'batch_process.batch_process()' does not use the GET argument "list_url" anymore ; it uses the GET argument "efilter" instead.
        # In 'creme_core.forms' :
            - The method 'mass_import.ImportForm.append_error()' only takes the argument "err_msg" now (there were 3 arguments).
            - The behaviour of the merge form with ManyToManyFields has been fixed ; the many to many data are changed during the save(), & not during the clean() anymore.
            - The behaviour of the bulk/inner edition with ManyToManyFields has been fixed ; the many to many data are changed during the save(), & not during the clean() anymore.
            - The rendering of widgets have been heavily reworked to use templates :
                - The methods 'format_output()' have been removed in the following class of 'widgets' : DatePeriodWidget, DurationWidget, OptionalWidget, DateRangeWidget.
                - In 'widgets.DateRangeWidget.render()', passing an attributes "render_as" not in {'table', 'ul'} will raise an exception ("template not found"). You can define your own type of render by creating a template file.
                - These methods of 'widgets.UnorderedMultipleChoiceWidget' have been removed: _render_header_filter(), _render_header(), _render_body(), _render_counter(), _render_viewless(), _render_footer().
                - If you inherit 'widgets.EnhancedSelectOptions' :
                    - It should be before the parent Widget class in the parents list.
                    - These methods have been removed : render_enchanced_option(), is_choice_selected(), render_enhanced_choice().
                - The method 'header_filter.EntityCellsWidget._build_render_context()' has been removed.

            - The attribute 'filtertype' of 'widgets.UnorderedMultipleChoiceWidget' now raises a ValueError if the given value was invalid (so a breaking indicates an existing bug).
        # The constructors of the following classes take an additional argument "model" : EntityCellActions, EntityCellFunctionField, EntityCellRelation, EntityCellVolatile.
        # The arguments of 'creme_core.utils.html.filter_img_src()' have change (to follow the API changes in 'bleach').

== Version 1.7 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # A new page header has been created ; it contains a new main menu which replaces the old main menu on the left side.
        - Menu entries are now grouped by features, and not by app anymore ; the creation entries are grouped together.
        - This new menu manages the user info, the log-out entry, the last viewed items, the trash.
        - The global search is now integrated to this header, and propose quick results (but the complete results are proposed too).
        - The old menu is still available (by configuration), but it will probably be removed in Creme 1.8.
    # A Job (i.e. background process) system has been added.
        - A Job can be spawned by users (JobType.NOT_PERIODIC) in order to safely manage a long server work
          (no web-server timeout, resume on failure, true results page when the task is finished, process limitation...).
        - The system Jobs are run periodically (JobType.PERIODIC), and can be woken up by user events (JobType.PSEUDO_PERIODIC).
          It avoids to have to setup a cron task (or worse under Windows systems...) which runs django commands ;
          & we get a GUI to enable/disable the job, and configure its periodicity. The possibility to refresh the wake up date
          allows very accurate execution (with a cron based execution the precision depends on the task periodicity).
          The results page is also better than server logs.
      Mass import (ie; CSV/XLS import) & batch process use now jobs.
      The command 'reminder' has been replaced by a Job too (see "Apps" section for apps commands changes).
    # The list-views have been improved :
        - The header scrolls in order to always be visible.
        - The UI for actions has been improved.
        - The ordering management has been improved :
            - The ordering is built by using the DB-indexes of the model in order to be as efficient as possible.
            - When a model use several fields for its default ordering (e.g. Contact uses last_name+first_name),
              all related direction (ASC/DESC) are inverted together (it's more logic & queries are faster).
            - ManyToManyFields columns are not sortable anymore ; it was probably confusing, slow & annoying for some future performance improvements.
        - When there are too many entities in the current list, a fast mode is used (see settings.FAST_QUERY_MODE_THRESHOLD) :
            - A new type of paginator is used. It does not allow to go to random page (only next & previous page are available),
              but it avoids/limits SQL's OFFSET whenever it's possible.
            - If no optimal ordering is found (not related SQL index), simpler ordering is used.
        - In the main SQL queries, the DISTINCT directive has been removed in simple cases to go fast.
        - When there is no filter or search, the COUNT query (to display the total number of entities) is fast because we avoid a JOIN.
        - All the parameters (view, filter, search...) are stored in the URI as argument, which is useful for bookmarking for example.
        - Two settings to customise the page sizes have been added : PAGE_SIZES & DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE_IDX.
    # The blocks system has been heavily reworked (they are called 'bricks' now in the code, because 'block' was confusing because of templates {% block %}).
      Most of the changes are under the hood (& so concern the developers) ; nevertheless many improvements are still visible to the end-users :
        - The global look & feel is much better ; the layout of many blocks have been reworked.
        - The blocks provide now a menu when you click on their icon ; it's the new way to collapse the blocks
          (instead of clicking of the block's header) & it allows some blocks to be directly configured without using the global blocks configuration.
        - The title bar is now a block. So it can be reloaded if some changes happen, & alternative bricks can be proposed (like the new "Card" blocks).
        - The reloading system is now smarter :
            - The page needs to be entirely reloaded less often.
            - It avoids some old strange (but generally not noticed) behaviours.
    # The UI has been improved :
        - The 2 themes have been heavily reworked.
        - The login page is faster & theme agnostic ; so do the error pages.
        - The page footer is nicer & displays more information.
        - An "About" page has been created.
    # Creme uses now named URLs everywhere in its code ; so it can be deployed in a sub-domain.
    # In the History, DateFields/TimeFields/DateTimeFields/FloatFields are better managed : old & new values are displayed now.
    # In EntityFilters, the ManyToManyFields have now the operator "is empty".
    # The errors of mass import can be downloaded as a file now (thanks to the new job results page) ;
      it contains the lines with erroneous data, and with an additional column with the error messages.
    # A new (home) block "Statistics", which regroups statistics from several apps, has been added.
    # The inner-popup dialogs have been improved :
        - The "escape" key closes the dialog.
        - When a dialog is closed, the page scrolls back to the opening position.
    # In forms, entities can be created in the multi-selection widgets (if a quick-form is available for this kind of entity).
    # The Merge feature has been improved :
        - The entities can now be merged from the list-view.
        - The widgets to select entities have been improved in the merge view (the "disabled" state works, so does the copy feature).
    # On the 'Relationships' block, the button "Delete all relationships" has been removed.
    # The XLS export backend has been improved, to be more robust against concurrent accesses.
    # Apps:
        * Documents :
            - The models Image & Document have been merged ;
              the model Image is removed & the existing instances are transformed into Document instances.
            - The forms of Document have been improved :
                - The file is now written during the 'save' step, not the 'clean' one.
                - The field 'title' is not required in the creation forms any more ; if the user does not fill it, the filename is used.
        * Persons :
            - Contacts & Organisations get a "Card" brick (use in the new install) to replace the classical title bar in their detail-views.
            - A new field has been added to Organisation in order to mark them as managed by Creme (instead of a CremeProperty).
            - An EntityFilter for Contacts has been added : "Me".
            - The model Contact & Organisation have new indexes which correspond to their default list-views,
              in order to improve the performances of the classical use.
        * Creme_config :
            - Several forms are wizards now :
                - It allows smarter creation forms. For example, no need to edit an empty custom block just after its creation.
                - The UserRole forms is more friendly. For example, it only proposes apps to administrate among the allowed apps.
            - The ContentTypes are now filtered in the credentials form (only entity types related to allowed apps are proposed) ; the credentials can now be edited.
        * Activities :
            - An EntityFilter for Activities has been added : "In which I participate".
            - In Activity forms :
                - The field "Users to keep informed" can now be removed by configuration (not displayed by default).
                - The fields for your own participation has been improved (now 1 field instead of 2).
                - The fields for Alerts have been improved.
        * Billing :
            - Inline billing-line form has been improved (user & dev sides) ; errors in the form are better managed.
              For example, the name of the related item is checked (cannot be empty) on new line & the errors are detected as soon as inputs are modified, not leaved.
            - The PDF generation has been improved ; the concurrent creation of temporary file has no more collision.
              The auxiliary files are now deleted when the PDF is OK.
            - Some small information leaking in FunctionFields have been fixed ; you could get the total of Invoices/Quote which you cannot view.
        * Products :
            - Products & Services can no be imported from CSV/XLS files.
            - The possibility to create Category/SubCategory directly in the forms of Product & Service.
        * Opportunities :
            - Opportunities get a "Card" brick (use in the new install) to replace the classical title bar in their detail-views.
        * Assistants :
            - The Reminders for ToDos & Alerts send now their emails to the related users.
            - The command 'usermessages_send' has been replaced by a job.
        * Emails :
            - The commands are now jobs.
            - The HTML body of Emails does not support links to 'Image' entities anymore (use external images instead).
        * Geolocation :
            - The possibility to use your Google API key has been added.
        * Projects :
            - The model Project has now a field 'currency', which is used to display costs.
            - The color of the related TaskStatus is displayed if the 'tasks' block.
            - The color of the related ProjectStatus is displayed in the list-view of Projects.
        * Commercial :
            - The command 'com_approaches_emails_send' has been replaced by a job.
        * Crudity :
            - The command 'crudity_synchronize' has been replaced by a job.
            - Beware: the owner of WaitingAction, History or EntityEmail instances can be different (compared to Creme 1.6)
              when the email sender does not correspond to a User/Contact.
        * Recurrents :
            - The command 'recurrents_gendocs' has been replaced by a job.
        * Events :
            - The form for Event has been improved : 'end' must be after 'start'.
        * Activesync :
            - This app is deprecated ; it is not in the default install any more.
              It will probably be removed in the next release if nobody works on it.
            - A job which does the synchronisation has been added ; the commands are still available, for debugging purpose.

        # A (model) ColorField has been added.
        # A new system for icons has been created :

            - Its possible to have inline SVG for an icon in a given theme.
        # About field printers :

        # In JavaScript :
            - An ESLint configuration has been added (needs nodejs).

            - 'CaptureQueriesContext' is a helper for the context with the same name in django.
            - 'QueriesPrinter' is context/decorator which prints SQL queries.
        # A new templatetag has been added: 'creme_latex.latex_escape'.

                * CTI :
                    - Some breaking changes in the view respond_to_a_call() (a true brick has been created, the context vars have been moved to this brick).
        # In settings.py:
            - USE_STRUCT_MENU has been removed & the old tree menu API has been removed (it was hidden & probably used by no one).
            - The JavaScript bundles has been split into several parts: lib & main.
        # In CremeAppConfig.register_menu(), the argument 'creme_menu' uses the new menu API.
          You can get the old API with 'settings.OLD_MENU = True' ('False' by default).
        # The apps are not registered in 'creme_core.registry.creme_registry' anymore ; only the apps registry of Django is used now.
            - 'creme_core.apps.CremeAppConfig.register_creme_app()' is not called by 'all_apps_ready()' anymore ;
              use the class attributes 'AppConfig.extended_app' & 'AppConfig.credentials' (added by Creme) if in your old code you used specific values for 'register_creme_app()' arguments.
            - These attributes of 'creme_core.registry.CremeRegistry' has been removed :
                register_app(), get_app(), get_extending_apps(), iter_apps() (use 'creme.creme_core.apps.creme_app_configs()' instead) , CRED_NONE, CRED_REGULAR, CRED_ADMIN.
            - The class 'creme_core.registry.CremeApp' has been removed.
        # In all apps :
            - The methods '*Config.register_blocks()' have been renamed 'register_bricks()'.
            - The blocks use some new templates files, which are in '*/bricks/' (instead of '*/templatetags/' generally).
        # The templates loader configuration (settings.TEMPLATES) has changed ; templates from apps directories are now loaded first.
        # A 'ForeignKey' or a 'ManyToManyField' related to a CremeEntity model & with an attribute 'limit_choices_to' which is a Q() (or a callable returning one)
          will cause an error when its form-field is generated (but it indicates a buggy code in your old Creme 1.6 based code).
        # In 'creme_core.models' :
            - If the ordering of a class inheriting CremeEntity is empty or uses the field 'id', it causes an error a starting (before there was just a log message).
            - Instances of 'CremeProperty' are now unique for couple (type, creme_entity).
            - Instances of 'UserRole' is now unique by 'name'.
            - Instances of 'CustomFields' are now unique for couple (content_type, name).
            - The attribute 'entity.EntityAction.icon' must be a new-style icon name (not a old-style icon path).
        # The behaviour of ordering NULL values is now uniform between the different RDBMS : NULL values are now considered as low.
          On PostgreSQL (where we use the SQL instructions NULLS FIRST/LAST), ordering of CremeEntity QuerySets has changed with order_by() on fields with NULL values.
        # In 'creme_core/templates' :
            - The <body> of the pages should now have an attribute 'data-bricks-reload-url' which contains the bricks-reloading URL.
            - In 'base.html', {% block bodyclass %} has been removed ; use {% block body_classes %} instead (beware, you have to remove 'class="').
            - Many changes in 'detailview.html' :
                - The <div> for buttons have changed their CSS class.
                - The class 'zone_spacer_5px' is not used anymore & the related <div> has been removed.
                - Several template {% block %} have been removed:
            - In 'generics/view_entity.html', if you override some {% block %} ('title', 'logo', 'entity_buttons'),
              you have now to use the header brick feature instead (by creating your own or override an existing one).
            - In 'generics/blockform/base.html', 'generics/blockformset/base.html' & 'generics/form/base.html',
              the context variable 'logo' is replaced by 'icon_name' (e.g. 'images/add_64.png' => 'add')
            - In form pages, the tags <table class="table_header" ...>  have been replaced by <div> tags.
            - Many changes in the HTML of list-views ; mostly in header & footer.
        # In 'creme_core.gui' :
            - The constructor of 'bricks.Brick' (aliased to 'block.Block' for compatibility) should be called if you write your own 'Brick' class.
            - In 'bricks._BrickRegistry.register_4_model()' the argument 'block' has been renamed 'brick_class'. A registered bricks should have an id_ == None.
            - 'fields_config.FieldsConfigRegistry.register()' has been removed.
            - The module 'list_view_import' has been renamed to 'mass_import'.
            - In the method 'listview.ListViewState.set_sort()', the argument 'field_name' has been renamed 'cell_key'.

                - The method 'CreatorEntityField.create_action_url()' now returns '' if no related quick-form is registered (& no custom URL is provided).
            - In 'bulk' :
                - The 'VIEW' permission is not checked explicitly anymore (so 'LINK' is checked instead by default by the field itself).
                - The classes inheriting 'BulkForm' must set the attributes 'bulk_cleaned_entities' & 'bulk_invalid_entities' or use the method '_bulk_clean()'.
                - The constructor of 'BulkForm' now requires the model as first argument ; don't forget to update registered custom inner/bulk forms.
                - The method 'BulkForm._bulk_related_formfield()' has been removed.
                - The global variable '_BULK_FIELD_WIDGETS' has been removed.

            - The module 'list_view_import' has been renamed to 'mass_import'.
            - The constructor of 'merge.MergeField' takes an additional positional argument : 'user'.

            - 'meta.FieldInfo' : slicing with a step (or a step!=1) raises now a ValueError (because it probably does not mean anything).

== Version 1.6 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The version of Django has been upgraded to 1.8.
        - There is now an integrated migration system, which is better than South. Only the command 'migrate' is needed & 'syncdb' is useless.
        - The new hint system performs some useful checking, like the apps dependencies.
    # A new feature has been added: FieldsConfig.
      It allows the users to hide fields everywhere in Creme (forms, blocks, listview...), directly in the "General configuration".
    # The blocks configurations can now be set by role.
    # Global search:
        - The search configuration can now be specific to a role ; configuration per user has been removed.
        - The configuration UI of search has been improved.
    # GenericEntityField and MultipleGenericEntityField can now create entities on-the-fly.
    # The quick search (search with listview columns headers) is now available for ManyToManyFields.
    # The emptying of the trash works now better with trashed entities linked between them.
      We try to delete the remaining entities (which could not be deleted because of relationships) when there are errors,
      while the previous iteration managed to remove some entities. It will not work with cyclic references (but it is certainly very unusual).
    # Model-fields as choices are now alphabetically ordered in forms (e.g. search configuration, report-graphs forms...).
    # Lots of labels in inner popups buttons have been improved(e.g. 'Save' -> 'Save the alert').
    # The display of History block has been improved (FK to CremeEntity, fields with choices).
    # DecimalFields are now displayed with a localised format.
    # The command 'creme_uninstall' has been heavily improved (more robust, clean more models, better display...).
    # Apps:
        * Projects :
            - The design of the tasks of project has been reworked.
              The ProjectTasks are not Activities anymore ; but instead they are linked to Activities which replace the Workingperiods ;
              the ProjectTasks still have the following fields: start, end, duration, description.
              The Contact linked to a Resource can now be changed ; but a Resource cannot be deleted if it is related to an Activity
              (before, the related WorkingPeriods were deleted too).
            - A Contact can now be created directly in the Resource form.
        * Tickets :
            - Tickets which are open since more than 7 days are displayed in red in the listview.
            - When a ticket is cloned, the status of the new ticket is 'Open', and its 'closing_date' is not copied.
            - The titles are not unique anymore.
            - Tickets have now a unique number.
        * Documents :
            - Two Folders can now be merged.
            - A new block is available for the Folders: "Child folders".
            - The Folders are now unique by ('title', 'parent_folder', 'category').
            - The model FolderCategory has a 'is_custom' field.
              Populated categories which are required for related documents and crudity attachments, are not custom (i.e. not deletable) anymore.
        * Persons :
            - Contact has a new field: full_position ('Detailed position').
            - The Contact/Organisation blocks for information & details are now built with the CustomBlock feature.
            - The name of the billing & shipping addresses is not asked anymore. They are automatically named.
        * Commercial :
            - A Market Segment can now be deleted (by replacing them by another one). The related property type is also replaced.
            - A Market Segment "All the organisations" has been added, with no related PropertyType.
        * Billing :
            - Invoice's total can now be negative.
            - The blocks for entity information are now built with the CustomBlock feature.
            - The model TemplateBase has now a 'Status' FunctionField.
            - When a related billing document is created, the source Organisation in not chosen in a separated innerpopup window anymore.
        * Activities :
            - The participants can now be created directly in the forms.
            - The max length of the field Activity.place is now 500 (it was 100).
        * Mobile :
            - The call minutes can be added from the call form.
    # Upgrade notes:
        - If you changed the setting INSTALLED_APPS (or INSTALLED_DJANGO_APPS), "mediagenerator" must be replaced by "creme.creme_core.apps.MediaGeneratorConfig",
          as in the vanilla creme.settings.py file.

            - In the templatetag creme_widgets.get_add_button: the template variable 'path' is deprecated.
            - (Multi)GenericEntityField.allowed_models property : the argument 'allowed models' should be an iterable (giving a not-iterable value is deprecated).
            - JSONField._build_widget() (set a class attribute 'widget' in your field instead).
            - AdaptiveWidget.
            - In _CremeTestCase :
                - assertFormSetError() (use assertFormsetError() instead).
                - autodiscover() (useless now).
                - create_image() (use creme.media_managers.tests import create_image() instead).

        # You can now clearly forbid a CremeEntity model to be cloned, with the new static method get_clone_absolute_url().
        # The view decorator creme_core.auth.decorators.permission_required() can take a list of permissions.

        # The support of custom labels for default dialog buttons has been added.
        # A file "project_settings.py" has been added ; it should contain the setting shared by all your team (e.g. INSTALLED_APPS).
          The settings has been improved in order to add other JS/CSS bundles ; see CREME_OPT_MEDIA_BUNDLES.
        # Several blocks templatetags can now take a URL (in order to give them reversed URLs) :
            - get_line_adder
            - get_line_linker
            - get_line_viewer
            - get_line_deletor

        # 2 signals have been added ; they provide a way to customize the uninstall.
        # Test models (i.e. models which only exist when tests are run) are used when it is possible (creme_core, reports).
        # Several ForeignKey fields are now OneToOneFields (RelationBlockItem.relation_type, HistoryConfigItem.relation_type) ;
          a new model field has been added: CTypeOneToOneField.
        # Apps :
            * Creme_config :
                - Models can now be unregistered from the registry.
            * Activesync :
                - CremeClient.user is now a OneToOneField.

    Breaking changes :
    ------------------
        # Changes caused by Django 1.5 :
            - Accessing reverse one-to-one relations fetched via select_related() now raises DoesNotExist instead of returning None.
            - In URLField, the argument 'verify_exists' has been deleted.
            - The commands should use self.stdout.write() & self.stderr.write() instead of 'print'.
            - django.utils.simplejson has been replaced by 'json'.
            - The methods Paginator.next_page_number() & Paginator.previous_page_number() raise InvalidPage exception, instead of returning '0'.
              So the footer of the listview (template) has been fixed.
            - The function django.utils.timezone.localtime() crashes if its arg is None.
            - The django validation message "Enter a valid e-mail address." has changed (now it's "Enter a valid email address.") ; some unit tests could fail.
            - _CremeTestCase.assertXMLEqual() has been renamed assertXMLEqualv2() to avoid the shadowing of the Django's method.
        # Changes caused by Django 1.6 :
            - The forms' Meta should have a 'fields' attribute (or an 'exclude' one).
            - The session is now serialized as JSON, so stored objects must be serializable.
            - The test runner & the test files layout have changed.
              For example, the old command "python manage test persons" has become "python manage test creme.persons.tests".
                - The python files 'foo.py' must be renamed 'test_foo.py'.
                - CSVImportBaseTestCaseMixin has moved to 'creme.creme_core.tests.views.base'.
                - The command 'test_creme' has been removed ('test creme' is OK).
            - BooleanField default is now 'None' (so 'False' should be set explicitly).
            - The entry Field.default_error_messages['invalid'] has been removed.
            - The CONTENT_TYPE key in test response is not available anymore (-> QUERY_STRING can be used instead with different value).
            - XViewMiddleware has been removed from settings.py.
            - There was a low level change in the SQLite backend + date format of dates as group key.
            - The error messages should use mapping keys instead of positional formatting. Some django error messages has changed, so some tests could fail.
        # Changes caused by Django 1.7 :
            - With the new AppConfig system, the files "creme_core_register.py" are not loaded anymore
                at startup & should not be used anymore; use CremeAppConfig instead.
            - Some imports have to be done lazily in order to avoid AppRegistryNotReady exceptions at startup.
            - The loading of models has changed, and errors caused by loop imports could happen.
            - django.forms.util has been renamed django.forms.utils.
            - The new migrations system caused many changes :
                - The model auth.User is not used anymore ; Creme has its own CremeUser model
                  Use the function get_user_model() or settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL to get it.
                - The old South migrations do not work anymore ; generate new migration files with the new command 'makemigrations'.
                  BEWARE : if you use ForeignKeys/ManyToManyFields/... to the old 'User' model, you'll have to rework the generated migrations (see vanilla apps)
                - You have to add a deconstruct() method to your custom model fields.
            - Do not use settings.INSTALLED_APPS in your code ; use django.apps.apps instead.
                Do not use settings.INSTALLED_CREME_APPS ; use django.apps.apps or creme_registry instead.
            - The commands which inherit AppCommand should implements handle_app_config() instead of handle_app().
            - The middleware configuration has been improved :
                - django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware has been added.
                - django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware has been added.
                - The order is the same than in the Django 1.7 settings template.
        # Changes caused by Django 1.8 :
            - The method QuerySet.select_related() now validates that the given fields actually exist.
              Previously, non-existent fields were silently ignored. Now, an error is raised.
            - The result of the method Meta.get_all_related_objects() has changed ; it's deprecated too.
            - ContentType.name is not a real field anymore ; you cannot perform query on it.
            - The module django.contrib.formtools has been removed ; it's a third party app now.
            - The module django.core.context_processors has moved to 'django.template.context_processors'.
            - Some private classes move from django.template to django.template.base, like VariableNode.
            - The method URLField.to_python() no longer adds a trailing slash to pathless URLs (it made some unit tests fail in 'vcfs').
            - The super methods setUpClass()/tearDownClass)()  must be called in test cases.
            - The instances of RequestContext are not filled by the context processors when they are built anymore, but only before the template rendering.
              So you'll probably need the new creme.creme_core.views.blocks.build_context() function for your own block reloading views.
            - The length of EmailFields is now 254 by default. CremeUser/Contact/Organisation have been migrated.
            - The commands should now use the method add_arguments(), based on 'argparse' (not 'optparse' anymore).
            - Some changes in the session implementation can make some low level tests fail.
            - Some changes in the DB management in unit tests can make some tests fail.
            - The settings for the templates configuration have changed.
              The setting TEMPLATES replace the settings TEMPLATE_* (e.g. TEMPLATE_LOADERS...) which are now deprecated.
        # Upgrade of several JavaScript libraries :
            - "Jquery" (1.11.2).
                - For 'checked' property use the prop() method instead of attr() (see jquery doc).
                - Tip: add the plugin jquery-migrate (1.2.1) whichs prevents compatibilities issues with previous jquery releases
                       and show deprecation warnings (see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/warnings.md).
            - "Jquery-ui" (1.11.4).
            - "Form" (3.51) (the changes written for 2.94 have been ported too).
            - "Chosen" (0.9.15) (the changes written for 0.9.8 have been ported too).
            - "Fullcalendar" (1.6.7).
            - "Qunit" (1.18).
        # The CremeEntity sub-classes should now have a method get_create_absolute_url() (excepted auxiliary ones).
        # The module 'creme_core.utils.contribute_to_model' has been removed (use model swapping instead).
        # In creme_core.utils.meta :
            - The function get_related_field() has been removed (its behaviour was very different with the underlying Django fields changes).
            - The function get_model_field_info() has been removed (it was deprecated).
            - The function get_verbose_field_name() has been removed (it was deprecated).
        # The template "creme_core/generics/blockform/add_popup.html" has been removed.
        # The tag 'enumerable' tag is now True by default in ManyToManyFields.
        # The constructor BasePopulator.init() takes 2 additional arguments ('stdout' & 'style').
        # The 'extra_q' argument of generic.listview.list_view_content (and so list_view() & list_view_popup_from_widget() which use it)
          can not contains a sub-queryset condition anymore (you'll get SerializationError) ; convert them into list.
        # GenericEntityField & MultipleGenericEntityField need the "user" attribute (for creation permissions).
        # In (Multi)CreatorEntityField, the hack which consisted to write "myfield.create_action_url = myfield.create_action_url" in order
          to activate the creation button on fields with q_filter does not work anymore. Use "myfield.force_creation = True" instead.
        # About RelationEntityField.allowed_rtypes (ie the setter & the constructor's attribute) : if an object evaluated to False was passed,
          all RelationTypes were allowed. This behaviour has been removed ; use RelationType.objects.all() instead.
        # In FilteredEntityTypeField, 'None' is not a valid parameter anymore for the constructor (but the default behavior did not change).
        # The widget Label displays its 'empty_label' if its value is evaluated to False (before: only if it was 'None').
        # When a Q() is used as 'limit_choices_to' attribute of a RelatedField in a CremeEntity, hide the field or set a custom form for inner-edition
          or it will cause a ValueError exception. The other cases are handled.
        # SearchConfigItem :
            - create_if_needed(): the argument 'user' has been replaced by the argument 'role'.
            - get_4_model() has been removed (it was deprecated).
        # The following JavaScript functions have been removed (they were deprecated).
            - creme.utils.bindShowHideTbody().
            - creme.utils.handleResearch().
            - creme.lv_widget.handleSelection().
            - creme.lv_widget.delete_a_value().
        # The view "/creme_core/enumerable/<content_type>/json" now returns a list of dicts instead of a list of tuples.
        # The middleware LogImportedModulesMiddleware has been removed.
        # Apps :

            * Documents :

== Version 1.5 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # Mobile, a new app. It provides 3 views which are specifically adapted to the cellphones.
        - The 'Home' page displays the Activities in progress and the Activities of the days.
        - The 'Directory' page displays the favorite Contacts and Organisations (and their employees).
        - The 'Activities' page displays the delayed phone calls, the activities without date and the activities planned the next day.
        - You can search Contacts & Organisations, and create them.
        - When you click on a phone number, and come back to the browser at the end of the call, a workflow panel allows you to
          create a phonecall Activity (if it did not exist) and set its status.
        - The (alternative) login view is on the URL '/mobile/login/'.
    # Geolocation, a new app. It adds some geolocation features for the Contact and Organisation addresses.
      For the time being, it uses only GoogleMaps service. 3 new blocks are available :
        - "Maps" shows the location(s) of a Contact/Organisation in a map by using their addresses ; the latitude and the longitude can be manually dragged on the map.
        - "Maps By Filter" shows the locations of all Contacts or Organisations for a given filter.
        - "Around this address" shows all the neighbours of a selected address ; the neighbours can be filtered.
    # A detail view for the PropertyTypes, which shows the tagged entities, has been added.
    # The inner/bulk edition has been improved :
        - The widgets are the same the full form ones, and so :
            - The creator widgets are now used with configurable models (e.g. Invoice.status).
            - The ForeignKeys to CremeEntities are now well managed (e.g. Contact.image).
            - The ManyToManyFields are now supported (e.g. Image.categories).
        - The form of a specific field can be customized in order to manage correctly its business logic (see 'Apps' section).
        - The support of related sub-fields (e.g. Contact.billing_address__city) has been added.
    # List view :
        - The quick search on properties is now possible.
        - The natural ordering of the models is now applied as default for listview (e.g. Organisation are ordered by their name).
          When a column is selected for ordering, both column order and default order are applied.
    # EntityFilters :
        - They can now be private ; it means that they can only be used by their owner.
        - The conditions on FK fields (e.g. Invoice.status) can now use a multi-selection.
        - The Empty/NotEmpty operators are enabled only when a field can be null.
        - The Date fields (regular & custom ones) now supports the Empty/NotEmpty operators.
        - The EntityFilters created by the 'populate' scripts (i.e. not custom) are now editable (but not deletable, and their name is not editable); their are versioned too.
          Their owner is now the first super-user (in order not all users can edit them).
          The versionning means that when a populate script is run again, if the script tries to create a filter which already exists (i.e. its PK exists) :
            - if the new version would have the same conditions, the name of the existing filter is updated (in order to fix a potential typo).
            - if the conditions are different, a new filter with the old one PK as base for its own PK (plus a version mark) is created ; the name is versioned too.
    # Listviews Views (HeaderFilters) :
        - They can now be private ; it means that they can only be used by their owner.
        - The Views created by the 'populate' scripts (i.e. not custom) are now editable (but not deletable).
          So, when the scripts are run again, the existing Views are not modified anymore (in order to keep the modifications of the users).
    # Global search :
        - The view uses now the GET method, so back button works well now.
        - The results blocks are now paginated.
        - The search on a model can be disabled in creme_config.
    # The CSV import can now set the CustomFields values.
    # You can now create an Entity "on the fly" with the multi-select widget for Entities.
    # A User and its related Contact are now synchronised (i.e. first_name, last_name & email remain equal).
    # The autocompletion has been added to several forms, to select a content type or a relationship type.
    # The non mandatory instances are not re-created anymore when the command 'creme_populate' is run.
    # The ordering of models has been improved: lots of models are now ordered by name/title.
    # Apps :
        * Reports :
            - A Report can (again) be created with no column.
            - The download form has been improved.
            - The graphs can save a default chart (bar, pie, tube...) for their next rendering.
            - The number of queries computing the graph data has been reduced.
            - The field Report.filter can now be inner-edited.
            - The "volatile" links have been improved :
                - Their name is always up to date & localized.
                - When a link becomes invalid, the error is displayed in creme_config.
                - They can be any valid/compatible relationship/FK, and not only the ones which correspond to a column of the related Report.
            - The export view now uses GET parameters, so it can be bookmarked for example.
        * Activities :
            - The type of an Activity can now be edited (and not only its sub-type).
            - The Organisations of the participants can be automatically added as subjects (it can be configured and it is enabled by default).
            - The Activities can now be imported (i.e. CSV/Excel files).
            - When a team is selected to be a participant, its teammates participate.
        * Persons:
            - You can now merge 2 Contacts if one of them is a user (but not 2).
            - A field 'order' has been added to StaffSize.
            - The field Organisation.siren is not unique anymore.
        * Creme_config :
            - You can not link an existing Contact when you create a User anymore.
            - SettingKey & SettingValue :
                - The values have a prettier display in their block (e.g. 'True' is now a localized "Yes").
                - The descriptions are correctly localized.
            - The permissions for the views which configure RelationTypes, PropertyTypes, Blocks... have changed from 'creme_config.can_admin' to 'creme_core.can_admin'.
              The related portals do not need specific permissions anymore.
        * Commercial :
            - Commercial action :
                - A counted entity can be directly created with a quick form, from the objectives block.
                - A linked opportunity can be directly created from the 'Related opportunities' block.
        * Recurrents :
            - The field RecurrentGenerator.periodicity is now a DatePeriodField. It allows more accurate periodicity :
              for example, you can set a real 'monthly' period, which is not equal to 30 days.
            - The wizard form is now closer to other forms.
        * Emails :
            - The available sender address of the EmailCampaigns is now stored in a SettingValue.
        * Billing :
            - CSV import: in update mode, you can choose to update or not the addresses from the target.
        * Products :
            - The fields Product.category & Product.sub_category can now be inner-edited.

        * Assistants :
            - The minimum hour for reminder is now configurable by the users (via a SettingKey/Value).
        * Tickets :
            - A field 'order' has been added to Priority, Criticity & Status.

                    - Address._get_info_fields() (use Address.info_fields instead).
                * Creme_config:
                    - The auto increment of 'order' field in creme_config is deprecated (use a BasicAutoField instead).
        # A new model field has been added: BasicAutoField ; it's a PositiveIntegerField which uses an autoincremented value when no value is given
        # A new class, FieldInfo, has been added in order to replace the function get_model_field_info().
        # 2 new SettingKey types have been added : HOUR, EMAIL.
        # A new DatePeriod system has been added (with a related model & form fields).
        # A new decorator for the view is available : creme.creme_core.auth.decorators.permission_required

        # The file 'requirements.txt' has been cleaned, and the recommended versions of these packages
          have been upgraded: Pillow, xlrd, south, pycrypto & restkit.

            * Reports :
                - A registry for types of charts (which allows to add custom ones) has been created.

    Breaking changes :
    ------------------
        # Python 2.7 is now the only supported version.
        # Deprecated stuffs which have been removed :
            - The function creme_core.utils.Q_creme_entity_content_types().
            - Two methods in Opportunity: get_target() & get_source().
            - All the deprecated credentials methods in CremeEntity :.
                - can_change() & can_change_or_die()
                - can_delete() & can_delete_or_die()
                - can_link() & can_link_or_die()
                - can_unlink() & can_unlink_or_die()
                - can_view() & can_view_or_die()
                - populate_credentials()
            - The form fields _EntityField/CremeEntityField/MultiCremeEntityField and the associated widget ListViewWidget.
            - JavaScript:
                - creme.utils.simpleConfirm()
                - creme.utils.postNReload()
        # The 'user' argument was removed from several methods :
            - Relation.populate_real_object_entities()
            - CremeEntity.populate_relations()
            - EntityCell.populate_entities()
            - HeaderFilter.populate_entities()
        # The method CremeEntity.get_edit_absolute_url() now returns '' (and not an invalid URL anymore) which means 'No edition' ;
          the base templates/templatetags use this official behaviour (view_entity.html, {% get_edit_button ... %}).
        # _BulkUpdateRegistry.register() args have changed. It is not anymore a list of tuples (model, list_of_field_names),
          but now it allows to register only a model at once, an optional list of field names, and an optional dict of custom forms.
        # ManyToManyFields are now inner-editable by default ; so you have to manage them with bulk_update_registry.register(MyModel, ...)
          if it causes a business logic problem (by excluding them, or adding a custom form for them).
        # SettingKey & SettingValue :
            - The SettingKey class is not a model anymore ; the SettingKey instances should be created
              in a setting_keys.py file and registered in your creme_core_register.py (see setting_key_registry).
            - The model SettingValue :
                - It has moved to creme_core (creme_core.models.setting_value.py).
                - The field  'key' (ForeignKey) has been replaced by a 'key_id' field (CharField) ;
                  so you could have to change some of your queries (e.g. '.filter(key=MY_KEY)' --> '.filter(key_id=MY_KEY)').
        # HeaderFilter.create() :
            - It does not modify an existing HeaderFilter anymore.
            - The owner cannot be a staff user.
        # EntityFilter.create() :
            - If the argument 'is_custom' is False, you have to give the conditions as argument too (this is a new argument) ;
              a new filter is created if the conditions (or the 'use_or' field) are different ; if there are identitical, the name is updated.
            - The owner cannot be a staff user anymore.
            - The characters '[]' are now forbidden in the PK (ValueError).
            - The 'ct' & the 'is_custom' value can not be changed if there is already an existing filter (ValueError).
        # _FieldPrintersRegistry :
            - The functions registered as field printers take now an additional 'field' argument.
            - The attributes css_default_listview & css_default_header_listview have been removed.
            - The method get_listview_css_class_for_field() & get_header_listview_css_class_for_field() can not take 'None' as argument anymore.
        # Templatetags :
            - 'enumerate' has been removed.
            - 'print_boolean' always returns a boolean widget (it does not check if the argument is a boolean anymore).
        # CSV import : ImportForm._post_instance_creation() takes now an additional argument 'updated'.
        # Reminders :
            - The Reminder class has changed :
                - The attribute 'id_' has been renamed 'id'.
                - The attribute 'model_' has been renamed 'model'.
            - The models which can be reminded must have a boolean field called 'reminded' (so assistants.ToDo & assistants.Alert have been updated).
        # The class creme.creme_core.core.entity_cell.EntityCellRegularField has changed : the property 'field_info' returns now a FieldInfo instance.
        # The variable settings.SHOW_HELP has been removed.
        # Apps :
            * Recurrents :
                - The forms given to the registry must take a new 'ct' argument ; the 'initial' argument is not set anymore.

== Version 1.4 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The HeaderFilter (listviews Views) form has a new UI :
        - You can now choose the order for all columns.
        - The UI is more compact and friendly (filter, search, drag n' drop).
    # Customisable object & relation blocks. You can choose the same fields as in HeaderFilter form (& the UI is very close too).
    # EntityFilter :
        - A new condition is available for ForeignKeys to User : current user.
        - The operators are now filtered according to the selected field's type (regular & custom fields).
        - Enumerable field choices are now displayed in a combobox (instead of a simple text field).
    # CSV import can now update existing entities instead of always creating them ; you can select several fields that act as a key.
    # The 'Ice cream' theme has been improved again : better contrast, separation lines, drop shadows...
    # There are some User management enhancements :
        - The superusers can now deactivate common users from creme_config (i.e. in a graphical manner).
        - The field User.is_staff is now used by Creme : the staff users are hidden from other users, and they cannot be selected to own entities for example.
          The staff users are used to help the other users, but they should not participate in the business.
          Staff users are created by the django command 'createsuperuser' (but the first superuser created after the syncdb command is not a staff user).
    # Minor UI improvements in forms :
        - Labels for submit buttons are now better ; for example 'Save the contact' instead of 'Submit' in the Contact creation form.
        - A 'Cancel' button is available in lots of forms.
        - A new JavaScript widget (CheckListSelect) is now used for multi-selecting without ordering : it uses check boxes and allows filtering/searching.
        - The order of the buttons in popups is now : OK/Cancel.
        - A new field to select several entities MultiCreatorEntityField replaces MultiCremeEntityField (but it does not allow inline creation yet).
    # Improved CSS for list views (fields are aligned differently according to their type).
    # A new pager for blocks has been added ; it manages large numbers of pages better.
    # A new command, called 'creme_uninstall', has been added : it can uninstall a Creme app in the good way.
    # A Unicode Collation Algorithm (derived from pyuca) is used to sort :
        - The apps in the menu, the creme_config portal, the UserRoles configuration.
        - The fields in the HeaderFilter form & in the search configuration.
        - The ContentTypes in <select>.
        - ...
    # JavaScript : some fallbacks for IE8 & 9 have been added. The support of IE 7 has been dropped.
    # The column titles in the list views are always up-to-date (before, they were computed during columns edition).
    # The error handling in inner popups has been improved.
    # A view for 409 errors has been created.
    # Apps :
        * Polls, a new app :
            - You can create a PollForm, which contains questions organised in sections, sub-sections etc...
            - Questions have a type (string, integer, boolean, enumeration...).
            - Questions can have conditions on previous questions : a question is activated only if its conditions are filled.
            - You can create several PollReplies from a PollForm, which snapshot the questions of the form.
            - A PollReply can be filled with a wizard, and answers can be edited later.
            - The PollReplies can be grouped by PollCampaigns.
        * Reports :
            * When you create a new Report, you can only select the columns from an existing HeaderFilter.
            * A new UI for the columns edition has been added, and it uses the work on the new HeaderFilter form.
            * ReportGraphs :
                - The form has been improved. Example : the field 'Is count' is already checked if there is no available aggregable field.
                - Only the ForeignKeys related to enumerable models are available (see the notes on 'enumerable' tag below) for the abscissa.
                - CustomFields are now available for abscissa & ordinate.
                - The graph design has been heavily enhanced. The data is emphasized by a clearer display :
                  many useless/annoying visual elements were removed, legends are better, many glitches were fixed...
            * Several behaviours have been fixed :
                - The column titles are now always up-to-date (before, they were computed during columns edition).
                - The 1st level entities are filtered by credentials ('view' permission).
                - When a FK field is linked to a sub-report, if a related entity does not pass the subfilter, the line is not dropped any more (related values are just empty).
                - The flattened sub-reports (ie not expanded, see 'selected' attribute) in columns associated to ManyToManyField/ForeignKey/related fields are now used.
                - The flattened sub-reports manage now all types of columns.
                - The aggregates are computed in a scope (so result may be different with an aggregate in a sub-report).
            * Invalid columns are automatically removed (e.g. removed CustomField).
        * Activities, the calendar has been heavily improved :
            * The version of fullcalendar.js has been updated from 1.4.5 to 1.4.7.
            * A new menu has been created, with :
                - Floating activities ; they can be drag n' dropped on the calendar, and filtered by their name.
                - All your calendars & the public calendars of all the other users.
                  Several calendars can be shown together (they have different colors) and they can be filtered by their name, or the first name and last name of their owner.
        * Billing :
            - The creation and the edition of billing lines have been redesigned, in order to use more client side computation.
            - A new field 'acceptation_date' (DateField) has been added to the Quote model.
            - A new field 'pending_payment' (BooleanField) has been added to the InvoiceStatus model.
            - 3 function fields are dynamically added by the 'billing' app to the models Organisation and Contact :
                - Total of pending payment.
                - Total number of won quotes this year.
                - Total number of won quotes last year.
        * Opportunities :
            - Opportunity.target field is now editable.
        * Products:
            - 'images' are now displayed in a true block (Products & Services).
        * Projects :
            - The Project.name field is not nullable anymore.

  Developers side :
  -----------------
    Non breaking changes :
    ----------------------
        # A new field tag has been created : 'enumerable'. When a ForeignKey is tagged as enumerable, it means that the related model
          can be enumerated, ie there are a limited number of instances. Eg : persons.models.Position are enumerable, but not persons.models.Address.
        # JavaScript :
            * A basic object derivation support (see creme.component.Component) has been added.

                - creme.dialog.Dialog is the new base dialog object.

        # CremeEntityField & MultiCremeEntityField form fields are now deprecated ; ListViewWidget too.
          use CreatorEntityField & MultiCreatorEntityField instead.
        # The function creme_core.utils.Q_creme_entity_content_types() is now deprecated.
        # The old migration scripts have been folded.
        # Apps :
            * Activities :
                - Calendar now has a field 'color'.
            * Billing:
                - The following constants are deprecated : PERCENT_PK, AMOUNT_PK & DISCOUNT_UNIT.
            * Opportunities:
                - The methods Opportunity.get_target() & Opportunity.get_source() are now deprecated.
