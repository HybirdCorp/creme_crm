== Version 2.3.5 Work in progress (not released -- this is a draft) ==

  TODO: recompile .mo (creme_config, emails)

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should re-generate the media files (creme generatemedia --settings=[...]).

  Users side :
  ------------
    # In 'creme.forms.widgets', the state 'disabled' has been fixed :
        - in 'CalendarWidget' (indeed the Javascript component 'creme.widget.DatePicker').
        - in 'TimeWidget' (indeed the JavaScript part 'creme.forms.TimePicker').
        - In 'OptionalField'.
        - in 'SelectorList'.
        - in 'UnorderedMultipleChoiceWidget' (indeed the JavaScript component 'creme.widget.CheckListSelect').


  Developers side :
  -----------------

    Non breaking changes :
    ----------------------
        # In 'creme_core.forms.fields.SelectorList', the constructor's parameter & attribute "enabled" are deprecated ;
          use <attrs={"disabled": True}> to disable instead (backported to Creme 2.3).
          The context variable "clonelast" is deprecated too.


== Version 2.3.4 ==

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should re-generate the media files (creme generatemedia --settings=[...]).

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The management of the properties constraints of a Relation view has been fixed
      (it was not mandatory to have all the needed properties).
    # The mass-import code checks now property constraints for relationships.
    # An issue with Firefox and 'creme.layout.TextAreaAutoSize' has been fixed.
    # Apps :
        * Persons :
            - The mandatory properties are now checked when a Contact (related to an Organisation) is created.
        * Emails :
            - The brick for Emails' history has been fixed: it was always empty.
        * Billing :
            - In the bricks of lines :
                - The width of <select> has been fixed (smaller now).

        * Projects :
            - The default form layout for ProjectTask has been fixed.
        * VCFs :
            - In the import form, the RelationTypes with property constraints are not proposed anymore
              (it's an easy way in order to respect the constraints, we could do better).


  Developers side :
  -----------------

    Breaking changes :
    ----------------------
        # The class 'creme_core.forms.fields.EnhancedChoiceIterator' now passes the whole dictionaries (excepted the key "label") it gets to the constructor of the choice.
          Eg: the argument "disabled" of 'creme_core.forms.widgets.EnhancedSelectOptions.Choice' can now be used by dictionary-choices.
          Beware: if your dictionary-choices contain some odd additinal keys, they are not ignored anymore & can make crash the choice's constructor.


== Version 2.3.3 ==

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should upgrade the minor version of Django 3.2 (3.2.13 or more).

  Users side :
  ------------

    # In blocks :
        - In History block, the modifications concerning entities which cannot be viewed are now hidden.

        * Billing :
            - There were issues when cloning/converting/generating-recurrently a billing entity :
                - Some useless Addresses were created.
                - The number generation was called too many times.
              BEWARE: when a Quote/Order is converted to an Invoice, the number of the Invoice is not automatically generated anymore.

  Developers side :
  -----------------

    Non breaking changes :
    ----------------------
        # There were issues when uploading file in popup for inner-edition.
        # A settings variable 'JQUERY_MIGRATE_MUTE' and a related context processor 'get_jqmigrate_mute'
          have been added to disable almost all the annoying warnings in the JavaScript console.
        # Some {% blocks %} were added in the content template of list-views.
        # The given help_text passed to {% brick_header_action %} is now used.


    Breaking changes :
    ----------------------
        # The context of 'creme_core.forms.widgets.DatePeriodWidget' has been fixed.


== Version 2.3.2 ==

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should re-generate the media files (creme generatemedia --settings=[...]).

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The behaviour of form fields to select entities has been improved.
      Entities in the trash & entities which are excluded from the given filter can be used as initial value (it was causing error 500).
      Validation error messages are better with deleted & excluded entities.
    # The filter conditions on Property can be applied on base entity (which unleashes some optimizations with credentials filters).
    # Some style element have been fixed :
        - The style of the mouse cursor has been improve on popover enumeration <a> (theme "icecream").
        - Some disabled buttons seemed not disabled.
    # The button to delete internal relationships in the relationships' brick is now disabled.
    # The item selection in table blocks has been fixed (used by 'crudity' & emails synchronisation).
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - In the users' configuration, the deletion button is disabled for the current user.
        * Billing :
            - The number of cloned Quote/SalesOrder has been improved.
              With managed source: it was incremented twice.
              With not managed source: it was copied (now set to '0' like newly created Quotes/Order).
            - The disabling of the buttons to created linked 'billing' entities has been fixed.
              They were not disabled when the user is not allowed to create the target entity type.

  Developers side :
  -----------------

    Breaking changes :
    ------------------
        # In 'creme_core.forms.fields' :
            - some error messages have changed.
            - some exceptions are raised when invalid PKs are cleaned on not required fields (when <None> was returned).
          (it may affect your unit tests)
            - 'CreatorEntityField.clean()' failed when an entity is found several times in a query with a JOIN.
        # The CSS class "forbidden" has been added to several buttons to be consistent.


== Version 2.3.1 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # A crash during an installation from source (with old version of setuptools) has been fixed.
    # The package 'reportlab' is temporarily pinned because 3.6.7 is not compatible with 'xhtml2pdf 0.2.5'.
    # The command 'creme_start_project' was not working correctly in packaged versions of Creme (some template files were missing).
    # The form widget to select several entities ('MultiEntityCreatorWidget') was broken when a button "Create" is displayed.
    # The buttons on hat-card bricks use now better the given 'help_text'.
    # Apps :
        * Persons :

            - The JavaScript code to create phone calls was broken.
        * Emails :
            - The "Refresh" button in synchronization page has been fixed.

  Developers side :
  -----------------

    Non breaking changes :
    ----------------------
        # With ForeignKeys to a CremeEntity model, the attribute "help_text" is
          now automatically used in the related form-field as expected.


== Version 2.3 ==

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should create a all new virtual environment based on Python 3.6+
      (eg: "mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3XX" if you use 'mkvirtualenv')
      and populate it with "pip install -e .[mysql|pgsql]" of course.
    - The layout of Creme projects has changed : Creme is a classical Python package
      installed in your virtualenv & your own data are stored in another place.
      Create a fresh project folder with the following command (you must be out of the Creme's tree):
          > creme creme_start_project my_project
    - Edit the file "my_project/settings.py" ;
      copy (carefully) the values from your old files "local_settings.py/project_settings.py".
        - Do not forget to set the values for LANGUAGE_CODE & TIME_ZONE (the default
          values in Creme 2.2 are 'fr' & 'Europe/Paris' ; if you did not set them
          in your instance of Creme 2.2, use these values explicitly with Creme 2.3).
        - The hard-coded sub-folder 'upload/' has been moved to the default value of 'settings.MEDIA_ROOT' ;
          so if you have set 'MEDIA_ROOT' in your personal settings, add a sub-folder "upload" at the end
          (to avoid breaking the paths of all your uploaded Documents, generated PDFs etc...).
          Example:
            > MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join('var', 'www', 'example.com', 'media')
            becomes
            > MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join('var', 'www', 'example.com', 'media', 'upload')
        - The value of 'settings.GENERATED_MEDIA_DIR' is not used anymore ; 'settings.STATIC_ROOT' is used instead.
          So if you have set 'GENERATED_MEDIA_DIR' in your personal settings, rename it "STATIC_ROOT".
          Example:
            > GENERATED_MEDIA_DIR = os.path.join('var', 'www', 'example.com', 'static')
            becomes
            > STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join('var', 'www', 'example.com', 'static')
    - If your old setting MEDIA_ROOT had the default value ("creme/media/"), copy the content of the
      folder "creme/media/upload/" of your old installation to the destination indicated by your new
      setting MEDIA_ROOT ("my_project/media/upload/" by default in the generated file "my_project/settings.py").
      If your old setting MEDIA_ROOT referenced a folder out of the default, you can just
      make a backup of these uploaded files (backups are a good thing).
    - Execute the well known commands "migrate", "creme_populate" & "generatemedia", but in a new way:
        > creme migrate --settings=my_project.settings
        > creme creme_populate --settings=my_project.settings
        > creme generatemedia --settings=my_project.settings
    - The undocumented options "colorize" & "colors" of 'creme.utils.loggers.CremeFormatter' have been removed ;
      fix your settings if you used it (probably not).
    - If you used the locale overloading (generated by the command "i18n_overload.py")
        - Copy the content of the old folder "creme/locale_overload/locale/" in a new
          folder "my_project/locale_overload/" (beware there is no "locale/" sub-folder).
        - In your project's settings, add the line:
            > LOCALE_PATHS.insert(0, BASE_DIR / 'locale_overload')

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The version of Django has been upgraded to "3.2".
    # The layout of Creme projects has changed : now Creme lives as a classical Python package
      in your virtualenv, and your settings/media are well separated from Creme's code
      (see the new command "creme_start_project").
    # Two full-python backends for the media-generator have been added ;
      they are used in the default configuration (see the setting 'ROOT_MEDIA_FILTERS') in order to remove the dependency to Java by default.
        - The package "csscompressor" is used to minify the CSS files.
        - The package "rjsmin" is used to minify the JavaScript files.
    # The history has been improved :
        - The messages in the history block are prettier.
        - Old & new values are stored now for TextFields (eg: description) ; they are shown in a popover dialog.
        - Elements which are added & removed for ManyToManyFields are now stored.
        - CustomFields are now historized too.
    # The global search can now search in CustomFields.
    # The job scheduler can now use a UNIX socket (when they are available) to
      communicate with the views, instead of a Redis server.
    # Many blocks got descriptions, which are displayed as tool-tips.
    # The field "modified" of entities is updated when you use inner/bulk edition with a CustomField.
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - The main menu can now be customised ; containers can be created,
              re-ordered, removed, & their entries can be chosen too.
              All apps have been reworked to use the new system to provide a menu identical to the old one.
            - You can add a configuration of a Custom-Form specific to a role.
            - The fields can now be marked as required in fields' configuration (not ManyToManyFields for now).
            - The instances of CremePropertyTypes can now be disabled (to not be proposed in forms).
            - The configuration form for blocks on detailed views has been redesigned
              (the pool of available blocks is now shared, blocks are draggable, descriptions are displayed).
            - A portal which displays all the filters (used by list-views) has been added.
            - A portal which displays all the views (of list-views) has been added.
        * Persons :
            - A many-to-many field "Spoken language(s)" has been added to Contacts ; it's hidden for old installations.
            - The setting PERSONS_MENU_CUSTOMERS_ENABLED has been removed (you can add/remove the entry menu in 'creme_config').
        * Billing :
            - The field 'payment_type' ("Settlement terms") is now present in all 'billing' entity types (Quote, SalesOrder...).
              Notice that if you upgrade your Creme installation, if you want to display this field in the detail-views, you
              have to edit your block configuration (excepted for 'Invoice' of course).
        * Reports :
            - The CustomFields with type DATE can now be used as abscissa in ReportGraphs (only DATETIME was available).
        * Emails :
            - When you create an e-mail from a detailed view, only one of the 2 bodies needs to be filled
              (the other one is automatically filled from it).
        * Assistants :
            - In Alerts & ToDos bricks, the validated lines can be shown/hidden. The default behaviour is still the same.

== Version 2.2 ==

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should create a all new virtual environment based on Python 3.6+
      (eg: "mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3XX" if you use 'mkvirtualenv')
      and populate it with "pip install -e .[mysql|pgsql]" of course.
    - Execute the well known commands "migrate", "generatemedia" & "creme_populate".
    - If you used CommercialApproaches, edit the configuration of Activities' custom-forms to add
      the field "Is a commercial approach?".

  Users side :
  ------------
    # A CustomForm system have been created : the forms for almost all entity types can be customised through
      a GUI in the general configuration. You can create groups of fields, chose which fields are used (some
      of them are required anyway) and their order. A basic layout system for the group allows you to display
      groups on the whole width, or on the half width (left or right).
    # CustomFields have been improved :
        - 3 new types of CustomFields have benn added : TEXT, DATE & URL.
        - New choices for ENUM (Choice list) & MULTI_ENUM (Multiple choice list) CustomFields can be created on-the-go in forms.
        - In mass import, duplicates choices are managed : no error is raised, the first choice is used.
    # Add a new secured view to download dynamic files (ie: uploaded files, files related to entity, files generated by export...).
    # Sending an entity to the trash (or restoring it) creates now an history line.
    # An exception handler for errors 400 (Bad Request) has been added.
    # In listviews, the popup which displays the selected entity filter information is replaced by a popover.
    # The buttons got descriptions, which are displayed as tool-tips.
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - Each user can now fix the language to use in the interface ; by default the language asked by the browser is used (like before).
            - The possibility to export & import some configured models has been added.
              It's useful to deploy a test/prototype server, & re-use their data on the production server.
              The transferred models are : UserRoles, HeaderFilters, EntityFilters, CustomForms configuration,
              CremePropertyTypes, RelationTypes, Bricks configuration, Buttons configuration, Search configuration.
            - The configuration of CustomFields has been improved :
                - CustomFields can now be marked as required.
                - CustomFields which are related to values cannot be deleted any more; they are just marked as deleted.
                  Marked CustomFields do not appear in list-views, reports etc...
                  If a marked CustomField has no value any more (ie: no entity uses it), it can be definitely deleted.
                - The management of choices for CustomFields (so with type ENUM or MULTI_ENUM) has been improved :
                    - A new view to manage them will improve the managing of great number of choices.
                    - The deletion view proposes now to replace a choice by another one in related entities.
                    - Duplicated choices are now avoided when creating or editing choices.
            - The deletion/replacement of UserRoles uses now the "deletor" Job.
            - A popover is used for permissions by filter in the role configuration.
            - In the configuration of bricks :
                - The constraints of InstanceBricks are displayed.
                - It's now forbidden to delete a RelationType brick, a custom brick or an instance brick when it is used in a configuration.
        * Reports :
            - In Reports, the aggregates related to hidden field are hidden too.
            - The way the abscissa & the ordinate of 'models.AbstractReportGraph' are stored has been rework.
            - The ReportGraph's form has been improved too :
                - The fields for abscissa & ordinate have been replaced by 2 composite/chained fields.
                - The new widget for abscissa does not perform AJAX requests & has autocompletion.
            - A new ReportGraph fetcher specific to Contact has been added : "belongs to the Contact/User".
            - The volatile link is now used to narrow the related list-view (when you click of a ReportGraph's brick).
            - The report graph bricks set now the compatible entities types (attribute "target_ctypes") ;
              so they are only proposed for detail-view's brick configuration which are relevant.
        * Billing :
            - A backend system to export documents as files replaces the old PDF export (based on LateX) ;
              Several backends have been created, based on: xhtml2pdf, weasyprint, xlwt (python packages) & pdflatex (external binary, like before).
              All these backends export PDF files, excepted the one based on 'xlwt' which exports raw data in XLS files.
              In the default settings, the one based on 'xhtml2pdf' & 'xlwt' are activated ; there are easy to install with "pip", even on Windows, & give good results.
              The 2 "new" PDF exporters ('xhtml2pdf' & 'weasyprint') got new visual design.
              If you were using LateX in previous releases, configure your setting 'BILLING_EXPORTERS', & then select it in the configuration GUI of 'billing'.
        * Activities :
            - The version of Fullcalendar has been upgraded (from "1.6.7" to "3.10").
            - The creation/edition of events through a range selection is now possible in the calendar.
        * Persons :
            - The constraints of the RelationTypes "owns => belongs to" have been narrowed to: [Contact, Organisation] => Organisation.
        * Tickets :
            - A field 'Status.is_closed' has been added ; it can be edited in configuration.
        * Commercial :
            - The constraints of some RelationTypes have been narrowed :
                - "has sold => has been sold by" : [Contact, Organisation] => [Product, Service].
                - with "completes a goal of the commercial action", this types cannot be subject any more :
                  Strategy, billing.{CreditNote, TemplateBase, ProductLine, ServiceLine}
        * Projects :
            - The fields "start" & "end" of Tasks cannot be emptied with the inner-edition any more.
              BEWARE: if you have empty values, they are replaced at migration (<0> for duration, <01-01-1970> for start/end).
        * Geolocation :
            - An OpenStreetMap backend and 3 related bricks have been added :
                 - OpenStreetMapDetailMapBrick
                 - OpenStreetMapFilteredMapBrick
                 - OpenStreetMapNeighboursMapBrick
        * Mobile :
            - A new SettingKey to configure the redirection links to "Google Maps" or "Open Street Map" has been added. Some examples :
                 - https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query={search}
                 - https://www.openstreetmap.org#map=18/{lat}/{lng}
                 - https://www.google.com/maps/?q={search}

== Version 2.1 ==

  UPGRADE NOTE :
    - You should create a all new virtual environment based on Python 3.5+
      (eg: "mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3XX" if you use 'mkvirtualenv')
      and populate it with "pip install -r creme/requirements.txt" of course.
    - If you override INSTALLED_DJANGO_APPS in you local settings, you should replace "django.contrib.contenttypes" by "creme.creme_core.apps.ContentTypesConfig" (see settings.py).
    - Execute the well known commands "migrate", "generatemedia" & "creme_populate".

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The version of Django has been upgraded to 2.2.
    # A field "description" has been added to CremeEntity. Data has been migrated for entities classes which already had this field, of course.
    # The credentials system has been improved :
        - The credentials can now be configured to forbid some actions.
          Eg: if you want a user to see all kinds of entities excepted one, you are not obliged to create all-minus-one credentials lines ; you can just allow all of types of entities & forbid this one.
        - The credentials can now use an EntityFilter.
            - These filters can check: regular-fields (not date ones), custom-field (not date ones), relationships, properties.
            - These filters can be specific to a type on entities ; when there is no specific type
                - Only regular-fields of CremeEntity are available (ie: user & description).
                - Custom-fields are not available.
            - These filters remain related to the credentials, & cannot be selected in list-views for example.
    # In the list-views :
        - The quick-search on numeric (integer/float/decimal) fields (regular & custom) has been improved : complex filter like ">100; <=250" can be used.
        - The selector of HeaderFilter now uses <optgroup> to group views by owner.
        - A description of the filter can be displayed (so you can see the conditions without editing the filter).
    # In the forms :
        - Most of the form for entities have now fields to add Relationships & Properties at creation.
          The setting "FORMS_RELATION_FIELDS" can be set to False to remove these new fields.
        - The inactive users are now in a specific <optgroup> in the "Owner" form-field.
    # In the global search, the searched string is split in words, which can be contained in different fields. Words can be grouped with " (double quote). Double quotes can be searched with \" .
    # The blocks configuration of "Home" can now be specific to a role.
    # The inner-edition in hat-card bricks is now possible.
    # A setting to initialize the field 'is_private' of creation forms for HeaderFilters & EntityFilters has ben added: "FILTERS_INITIAL_PRIVATE".
    # The file "requirements.txt" has been split for different RDBMS.
    # A command to create staff users has been added : "creme_createstaffuser".
      Previously you had to modify manually (in DB or with Python code) the field 'is_staff'.
    # Apps :
        * Creme_config :
            - The deletion of instance has been improved.
              The removing of an instance (of a registered model) uses now a form which proposes a replacement value for the different kind of entities using it.
              The replacement is then processed by a job.
            - In the block to configure Users, inactive users can be hidden (from the block menu in its header).
        * Persons :
            - A view to create "suspect/prospects/customer" has been added.
            - A new quick-search field for Address has been added. It searches in all (not-hidden) fields of the related addresses.
            - A setting to hide the entry "My customers / prospects / suspects" in the main menu has been added : "PERSONS_MENU_CUSTOMERS_ENABLED".
        * Activities :
            - The calendar view has been improved :
                - Selected Calendars are kept in session.
                - Users are ordered alphabetically.
                - Inactive & staff users are excluded from the users list.
            - A default public calendar is now created when a user (not a staff one) is created.
              The old behaviour can be set with "ACTIVITIES_DEFAULT_CALENDAR_IS_PUBLIC = None" in your file '{local,project}_settings.py'.
        * Billing :
            - A field has been added in 'Invoice' : number of buyer's order. It's required by the french legislation.
            - The buttons (in button bar) to create related Quote/Invoice/... redirects now to the new entity's detail-view.
              The old behaviour (ie: staying on the Contact/Organisaton's detail-view) can be restored in the billing's configuration portal.
        * Opportunities :
            - The statuses of the billing documents are now displayed in the bricks of the detail-view.
            - Two SettingKeys which add constraints on selected billing documents to link have been added : same emitter & same target than the Opportunity.
            - The hat-card brick now only displays a maximum of 5 related Contacts.
        * Reports :
            - The chart's type and the order of a ReportGraph are saved when changed from the preview on a block.
            - The description of the filter used by a Report can be seen in the list-view & the detail-view.
        * Assistants :
            - The FunctionFields have now the quick-search feature (to search related Alerts/ToDos/Memos from the list-views).
        * Graphs :
            - The module "pygraphviz" has been removed from the main 'requirements.txt'. The "download PNG" button is displayed only if the package is installed.
        * Events :
            - The buttons of the related contacts list-view have been improved.
                - A button "Back to the event" has been added.
                - Some buttons have been removed :
                    - Mass import (imported contacts won't be linked to the event automatically which is confusing).
                    - Batch process (process contacts won't be filtered to be linked to the event).
                    - Export header (because it's mostly useful for mass import).

  Developers side :
  -----------------
      In this version, there are 3 main changes for developers :
        - The version of Django is now "2.2".
          You should probably read the following releases notes for Django versions :
            - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/releases/2.0/
            - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/releases/2.1/
            - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/releases/2.2/
        - The work on class-based views continues ; lots ot new function-views have been converted, but the biggest
          changes happened for list-views.
          The compatibility with function-views is totally broken, but migrating the code of your own list-views should be easy in most cases.
          This new class-based list-view is more stronger ; for example you can now easily customise the buttons & the actions.
        - The way the registration in 'creme_config' is done has heavily changed.
          Now a method in the files "apps.py" is used instead of the files "creme_config_register.py".
          Lot of things can now be configured about a model :
            - The forms for creation & edition can now be different ; the deletion form can be customised now.
            - The creation, edition & deletion URLs can be customised.
            - The creation, edition & deletion can be disabled.
            - The Brick used to display its instances can be customised.

      Other important changes:
        - The code related to EntityFilters have been heavily reworked (but it won't be a problem if you did not modified it) :
            - A lot of code from 'creme_core.models.EntityFilterCondition' has moved to a new package : 'creme_core.core.entity_filter'.
            - The code of the forms has notably been split (fields/widgets/forms).
            - A new registry has been created to register handlers (which contain the behaviour code which was in 'EntityFilterCondition') & operands (new name for 'EntityFilterVariable').
        -  The code of the search in list-views has been massively reworked.
           The old code was monolithic ; the new one is more extensible & customisable : it is separated in form/fields/widgets (like regular forms, plus some specialization).
           A tree-registry has been created in order to easily customise the search-fields used for each column of the list-views
           (see 'AppConfig.register_search_fields()' & 'creme_core.gui.listview.search.search_field_registry').

  Developers side :
  -----------------
      In this version, there are 2 main changes for developers :
        - We now use <Python 3.5> instead of <Python 2.7>.
          You can find the complete release notes of Python versions here :
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.1.html
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html
             https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html
          The code has not been fixed to "just work" ; lots of changes have been done to be more consistent.
            eg: several methods called 'itervalues()' have been deprecated because their name was referencing the old dictionary API.
          Lots of <%s-format> string have been converted to <{}-format">.
        - Views are going to class :
            - Almost all generic views of 'creme_core' are now class-based (but not list-views yet) ; the generic function-views are now deprecated.
              All apps have been updated to use these new classes ; the function-views using old generic views have been deprecated (or sometimes removed).
            - Lots of function-based views have been converted.
           NB: removed functions are indicated in this changelog ; for the deprecated ones there are warnings.

      Other important changes:
        - The list-view action (for single & bulk actions) system has been totally reworked (Python & JavaScript sides).
          Actions are now classes inheriting 'creme_core.gui.actions.UIAction', & are registered with 'CremeAppConfig.register_actions()' in your 'apps.py'.
          So it's easier to add/override/remove them from another app.
        - The registration of FunctionFields has been reworked. It's now external to the models (done in files 'apps.py' with 'CremeAppConfig.register_function_fields()') ;
          so it's easier to add/override/remove them from another app.
        - A new module, 'creme_core.core.enumerable', allows to retrieve & customise the choices related to a model-field.
          It's used by list-views, filter form or ReportGraph.
        - The old popup system is almost ready to be removed ; it's now only used by list-views & deprecated generic views ;
          beware to use the new templates for popup when you use the new generic class-based views for popup
          (if you don't set the attribute "template_name", the default value will be OK).
        - The "qfilter" argument for list-view uses a new format, more powerful than the old one.
          It's a true serialization of Q objects ; so 'OR' combinations can be used for example (only 'AND' were possible with the old format).

        # A new hint, indicating when a swapped URL has never been defined, has been added (see 'creme.creme_core.conf.urls.Swappable') ;
          it could "break" an existing application (because the code stops on a fatal error at starting), but it would indicate an existing bug.
        # The model 'creme_core.models.Relation' now explicitly avoids duplicates.
          A new manager has been added, with 3 methods to handle this smoothly: safe_create(), safe_get_or_create() & safe_multi_save()
        # A new models field has been created : EntityCTypeForeignKey.
          It looks like a GenericForeignKey, but it references only CremeEntities ; it uses a true ForeignKey for the entities, so it's possible to use classical filtering on FKs.
        # A specific manager has ben added to 'creme_core.models.SettingValue', with a method which keeps retrieved instances in a (per-request) cache.
        # A generic view to help the disabling of an URL has been added : the class-based view 'creme_core.views.generic.placeholder.ErrorView'.
        # A new collection has been added : 'creme_core.utils.collections.InheritedDataChain'.
          It facilitates the writing of registries by models when data from parent classes are used too.
        # Two templatetags to store safely JSON data have been added : {% jsondata %} & {% blockjsondata %}.
        # A simple HTTP server has been added in unit tests to serve static files.
        # The command "i18n_empty" has been improved :
            - The context is now used. eg: an empty entry with a context is not ignored because an entry with he same 'msgid' (but without context) is filled.
            - The line numbers in the PO files are now displayed.

        # Django 1.11 raises UnorderedObjectListWarning warnings when the pagination is made on a unordered queryset ; some models were missing a Meta.ordering.
        # A model FileRef has been added ; it provides a way to remove an old bug with deletion of model referencing files.
          The related files were automatically delete when instances were deleted, so it caused problems when the DB deletion was rollbacked.
          Now a FileRef, which references the file, is created at deletion (so it's creation is cancelled on a rollback) and the new file cleaner Job will delete these FileRef instance (& the related file).
          FileRef will be useful in the future for files created dynamically (like in export views).
        # Some template filters have been added in 'creme_core_tags' : lt, lte, gt, gte, eq.
        # The test runner now creates a mock/temporary 'settings.MEDIA_ROOT' directory. So the files created in unit tests (eg: uploaded files) are not spoiling the real 'upload/' directory.
          This temporary directory is removed at the end of tests ; there is no need to take care about deleting only the tests files any more.
        # In JavaScript :
            - The option "validator" in 'creme.dialog.FormDialog' now accepts the value "innerpopup" to continue to handle old-styled-popup HTML (<div class="in-popup" ...>)

        # Changes caused by Django 1.9 :
            - If a 'simple_tag' returns HTML, the result will be escaped if it is not mark_safe()'ed. The best way is to use 'format_html()' & 'format_html_join()' (the result is escaped, so marked as safe).
            - In templates, using _() on a classical-format string (with "%s") does not work like before, & should be avoided (because it returns a string with "%%s").
              The new way is to use {% trans %}/{% blocktrans %}, & regenerate the related PO files
              (notice that in the .po file, 'msgid/msgstr' will use "%%s", but the string returned by 'gettext()' will contain a simple "%s").
            - CharFields in forms strip their content by default.
            - The import of some models is done later (ie import in function code, not module root).
            - If you create your own model field inheriting ForeignKey/OneToOneField, you cannot set a model during migration for 'to' attribute.
            - If you import the module 'creme_config.registry', the import should be done after all the app configs are ready (eg: importing within a view function) in order to avoid errors.
            - Django 1.9 does not like '/' at the beginning of URL regex (it says it's useless, but it can be useful in some rare cases).
            - The MIMEtype of e-mail attachments is now set.
        # Changes caused by Django 1.10 :
            - The method 'Command.execute()' will crash if all arguments do not receive a value (use 'django.core.management.call_command()' instead).
            - The variable 'django.utils.http.PROTOCOL_TO_PORT' has been removed (seems not documented).
        # Changes caused by Django 1.11 :
            - The rendering of form-widgets has changed ; the compatibility with existing 'render()' methods does not always work.
              So you should use the new template-based system instead (it's what have been done in Creme -- see below).
            - The method 'Widget.format_output()' has been removed (a custom widget template should be used instead).
            - The arguments of 'creme_core.forms.bulk.BulkFieldSelectWidget.build_attrs()' have changed to follow the Django 1.11 signature.
            - In unit tests, (fake) e-mails are not sent when the recipient is empty anymore.
        # Most of libraries have been upgraded :
            - 'bleach' 1.4.X => 2.1.X.
            - 'xlrd' : 0.9.X => 1.1.X
            - 'xlwt' 1.0.X => 1.3.X.
            - 'Pillow' : 3.4.X => 5.X.
            - 'pygraphviz' : 1.1.X => 1.3.X.
        # In settings :
            - 'MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES' has been removed & replaced by 'MIDDLEWARE'.
            - The default settings 'LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL' & 'LOGIN_URL' use now named URLs.
            - The setting 'LOGOUT_URL' has been removed, because Django (1.10) removed it too (it was unused anyway).
            - The settings which were tuples are now lists (like in Django 1.9 global_settings), excepted 'COPY_MEDIA_FILETYPES' which is now a 'set'.
            - The middleware "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware" has been added in the default configuration ; it probably won't be a problem excepted on very specific install.
            - Beware 'formtools' has been added in 'INSTALLED_DJANGO_APPS'.
            - The logging configuration have slightly changed (formats of messages are different).
        # Using a method 'register_setting_key()' in a class inheriting CremeAppConfig is deprecated ; rename it 'register_setting_keys()'.
        # In views of all apps, the content-type of the response have been cleaned ; it probably does not break anything (or only unit tests).

    Internal breaking changes :

            - The method '_render_inputs()' of 'ChainedInput' & 'PolymorphicInput' have been removed.

== Version 1.7 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # A new page header has been created ; it contains a new main menu which replaces the old main menu on the left side.
        - Menu entries are now grouped by features, and not by app anymore ; the creation entries are grouped together.
        - This new menu manages the user info, the log-out entry, the last viewed items, the trash.
        - The global search is now integrated to this header, and propose quick results (but the complete results are proposed too).
        - The old menu is still available (by configuration), but it will probably be removed in Creme 1.8.
    # A Job (ie: background process) system has been added.
        - A Job can be spawned by users (JobType.NOT_PERIODIC) in order to safely manage a long server work
          (no web-server timeout, resume on failure, true results page when the task is finished, process limitation...).
        - The system Jobs are run periodically (JobType.PERIODIC), and can be woke up by user events (JobType.PSEUDO_PERIODIC).
          It avoids to have to setup a cron task (or worse under Windows systems...) which runs django commands ;
          & we get a GUI to enable/disable the job, and configure its periodicity. The possibility to refresh the wake up date
          allows very accurate execution (with a cron based execution the precision depends on the task periodicity).
          The results page is also better than server logs.
      Mass import (ie; CSV/XLS import) & batch process use now jobs.
      The command 'reminder' has been replaced by a Job too (see "Apps" section for apps commands changes).
    # The list-views have been improved :
        - The header scrolls in order to always be visible.
        - The UI for actions has been improved.
        - The ordering management has been improved :
            - The ordering is built by using the DB-indexes of the model in order to be as efficient as possible.
            - When a model use several fields for its default ordering (eg: Contact uses last_name+first_name),
              all related direction (ASC/DESC) are inverted together (it's more logic & queries are faster).
            - ManyToManyFields columns are not sortable anymore ; it was probably confusing, slow & annoying for some future performance improvements.
        - When there are too many entities in the current list, a fast mode is used (see settings.FAST_QUERY_MODE_THRESHOLD) :
            - A new type of paginator is used. It does not allow to go to random page (only next & previous page are available),
              but it avoids/limits SQL's OFFSET whenever it's possible.
            - If no optimal ordering is found (not related SQL index), simpler ordering is used.
        - In the main SQL queries, the DISTINCT directive has been removed in simple cases to go fast.
        - When there is no filter or search, the COUNT query (to display the total number of entities) is fast because we avoid a JOIN.
        - All the parameters (view, filter, search...) are stored in the URI as argument, which is useful for bookmarking for example.
        - Two settings to customise the page sizes have been added : PAGE_SIZES & DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE_IDX.
    # The blocks system has been heavily reworked (they are called 'bricks' now in the code, because 'block' was confusing because of templates {% block %}).
      Most of the changes are under the hood (& so concern the developers) ; nevertheless many improvements are still visible to the end-users :
        - The global look & feel is much better ; the layout of many blocks have been reworked.
        - The blocks provide now a menu when you click on their icon ; it's the new way to collapse the blocks
          (instead of clicking of the block's header) & it allows some blocks to be directly configured without using the global blocks configuration.
        - The title bar is now a block. So it can be reloaded if some changes happen, & alternative bricks can be proposed (like the new "Card" blocks).
        - The reloading system is now smarter :
            - The page needs to be entirely reloaded less often.
            - It avoids some old strange (but generally not noticed) behaviours.
    # The UI has been improved :
        - The 2 themes have been heavily reworked.
        - The login page is faster & theme agnostic ; so do the error pages.
        - The page footer is nicer & displays more information.
        - An "About" page has been created.
    # Creme uses now named URLs everywhere in its code ; so it can be deployed in a sub-domain.
    # In the History, DateFields/TimeFields/DateTimeFields/FloatFields are better managed : old & new values are displayed now.
    # In EntityFilters, the ManyToManyFields have now the operator "is empty".
    # The errors of mass import can be downloaded as a file now (thanks to the new job results page) ;
      it contains the lines with erroneous data, and with an additional column with the error messages.
    # A new (home) block "Statistics", which regroups statistics from several apps, has been added.
    # The inner-popup dialogs have been improved :
        - The "escape" key closes the dialog.
        - When a dialog is closed, the page scrolls back to the opening position.
    # In forms, entities can be created in the multi-selection widgets (if a quick-form is available for this kind of entity).
    # The Merge feature has been improved :
        - The entities can now be merged from the list-view.
        - The widgets to select entities have been improved in the merge view (the "disabled" state works, so does the copy feature).
    # On the 'Relationships' block, the button "Delete all relationships" has been removed.
    # The XLS export backend has been improved, to be more robust against concurrent accesses.
    # Apps:
        * Documents :
            - The models Image & Document have been merged ;
              the model Image is removed & the existing instances are transformed into Document instances.
            - The forms of Document have been improved :
                - The file is now written during the 'save' step, not the 'clean' one.
                - The field 'title' is not required in the creation forms any more ; if the user does not fill it, the filename is used.
        * Persons :
            - Contacts & Organisations get a "Card" brick (use in the new install) to replace the classical title bar in their detail-views.
            - A new field has been added to Organisation in order to mark them as managed by Creme (instead of a CremeProperty).
            - An EntityFilter for Contacts has been added : "Me".
            - The model Contact & Organisation have new indexes which correspond to their default list-views,
              in order to improve the performances of the classical use.
        * Creme_config :
            - Several forms are wizards now :
                - It allows smarter creation forms. Eg: no need to edit an empty custom block just after its creation.
                - The UserRole forms is more friendly. Eg: it only proposes apps to administrate among the allowed apps.
            - The ContentTypes are now filtered in the credentials form (only entity types related to allowed apps are proposed) ; the credentials can now be edited.
        * Activities :
            - An EntityFilter for Activities has been added : "In which I participate".
            - In Activity forms :
                - The field "Users to keep informed" can now be removed by configuration (not displayed by default).
                - The fields for your own participation has been improved (now 1 field instead of 2).
                - The fields for Alerts have been improved.
        * Billing :
            - Inline billing-line form has been improved (user & dev sides) ; errors in the form are better managed.
              Eg: the name of the related item is checked (cannot be empty) on new line & the errors are detected as soon as inputs are modified, not leaved.
            - The PDF generation has been improved ; the concurrent creation of temporary file has no more collision.
              The auxiliary files are now deleted when the PDF is OK.
            - Some small information leaking in FunctionFields have been fixed ; you could get the total of Invoices/Quote which you cannot view.
        * Products :
            - Products & Services can no be imported from CSV/XLS files.
            - The possibility to create Category/SubCategory directly in the forms of Product & Service.
        * Opportunities :
            - Opportunities get a "Card" brick (use in the new install) to replace the classical title bar in their detail-views.
        * Assistants :
            - The Reminders for ToDos & Alerts send now their emails to the related users.
            - The command 'usermessages_send' has been replaced by a job.
        * Emails :
            - The commands are now jobs.
            - The HTML body of Emails does not support links to 'Image' entities anymore (use external images instead).
        * Geolocation :
            - The possibility to use your Google API key has been added.
        * Projects :
            - The model Project has now a field 'currency', which is used to display costs.
            - The color of the related TaskStatus is displayed if the 'tasks' block.
            - The color of the related ProjectStatus is displayed in the list-view of Projects.
        * Commercial :
            - The command 'com_approaches_emails_send' has been replaced by a job.
        * Crudity :
            - The command 'crudity_synchronize' has been replaced by a job.
            - Beware: the owner of WaitingAction, History or EntityEmail instances can be different (compared to Creme 1.6)
              when the email sender does not correspond to a User/Contact.
        * Recurrents :
            - The command 'recurrents_gendocs' has been replaced by a job.
        * Events :
            - The form for Event has been improved : 'end' must be after 'start'.
        * Activesync :
            - This app is deprecated ; it is not in the default install any more.
              It will probably be removed in the next release if nobody works on it.
            - A job which does the synchronisation has been added ; the commands are still available, for debugging purpose.

            - Reversed URLs are used everywhere ; you should get existing URLs in your code, and name your URLs too.
            - An app can override its URL-root ; it's useful to mask some URLs of another app.
            - An app can have no file 'urls.py'.
        # ForeignKey & ManyToManyField are hooked to automatically use (Multi)CreatorEntityField in related forms when if makes sense
          (ie: they are related to a CremeEntity model).
          The attribute 'limit_choices_to' is managed, but it must be a dict or a callable returning a dict.
        # A (model) ColorField has been added.
        # A new system for icons has been created :
            - It allows to have different sizes for a same icon in different themes.

            - (Multi)CreatorEntityField.

        # In JavaScript :
            - An ESLint configuration has been added (needs nodejs).
            - In 'creme.dialog.Dialog':
                - Two options "minWidth" & "minHeight" have been added (they only works when the option "fitFrame" is disabled).
                - The possibility to redirect to an URL (static or in the response) on the form dialog success (options "redirectOnSuccess"/"redirectOnSuccessUrl").
            - In 'creme.widget.ActionButtonList', the update of delegate widget has been added (used for CreationButton).
            - In 'creme.widget.ChainedSelect', the update of subwidgets has been added.

        # A class which creates files atomically has been added : creme_core.utils.file_handling.FileCreator.
        # Two context managers which help profiling queries have beebn added in 'creme.creme_core.utils.profiling'.
            - 'CaptureQueriesContext' is a helper for the context with the same name in django.
            - 'QueriesPrinter' is context/decorator which prints SQL queries.
        # A new templatetag has been added: 'creme_latex.latex_escape'.
        # About commands :
            - A command which creates a lot of random entities (Contacts & Organisations) has been added (for performance benchmarking): 'entity_factory'.
            - A command which searches not translated messages has been added : 'i18n_empty'.
            - The command 'i18n_overload' has been improved :
                - A new option '--comment_useless', which helps to remove useless messages, has been added.
                - A new option '--js' to inspect & create files djangojs.po has been added.
        # Apps:
            * Emails :
                - The mandatory dependency to 'crudity' has been removed.
            * Billing :
                - It's now easier to add a new child class of Line in custom code (see apps.BillingConfig.register_billing_lines()).

                    - The method CrudityInput.handle() returns a backend instance or None (instead of a boolean).

                * CTI :
                    - Some breaking changes in the view respond_to_a_call() (a true brick has been created, the context vars have been moved to this brick).
        # In settings.py:
            - USE_STRUCT_MENU has been removed & the old tree menu API has been removed (it was hidden & probably used by no one).
            - The JavaScript bundles has been split into several parts: lib & main.
        # In CremeAppConfig.register_menu(), the argument 'creme_menu' uses the new menu API.
          You can get the old API with 'settings.OLD_MENU = True' ('False' by default).
        # The apps are not registered in 'creme_core.registry.creme_registry' anymore ; only the apps registry of Django is used now.
            - 'creme_core.apps.CremeAppConfig.register_creme_app()' is not called by 'all_apps_ready()' anymore ;
              use the class attributes 'AppConfig.extended_app' & 'AppConfig.credentials' (added by Creme) if in your old code you used specific values for 'register_creme_app()' arguments.
            - These attributes of 'creme_core.registry.CremeRegistry' has been removed :
                register_app(), get_app(), get_extending_apps(), iter_apps() (use 'creme.creme_core.apps.creme_app_configs()' instead) , CRED_NONE, CRED_REGULAR, CRED_ADMIN.
            - The class 'creme_core.registry.CremeApp' has been removed.
        # In all apps :
            - The methods '*Config.register_blocks()' have been renamed 'register_bricks()'.
            - The blocks use some new templates files, which are in '*/bricks/' (instead of '*/templatetags/' generally).
        # The templates loader configuration (settings.TEMPLATES) has changed ; templates from apps directories are now loaded first.
        # A 'ForeignKey' or a 'ManyToManyField' related to a CremeEntity model & with an attribute 'limit_choices_to' which is a Q() (or a callable returning one)
          will cause an error when its form-field is generated (but it indicates a buggy code in your old Creme 1.6 based code).
        # In 'creme_core.models' :
            - If the ordering of a class inheriting CremeEntity is empty or uses the field 'id', it causes an error a starting (before there was just a log message).
            - Instances of 'CremeProperty' are now unique for couple (type, creme_entity).
            - Instances of 'UserRole' is now unique by 'name'.
            - Instances of 'CustomFields' are now unique for couple (content_type, name).
            - The attribute 'entity.EntityAction.icon' must be a new-style icon name (not a old-style icon path).
        # The behaviour of ordering NULL values is now uniform between the different RDBMS : NULL values are now considered as low.
          On PostgreSQL (where we use the SQL instructions NULLS FIRST/LAST), ordering of CremeEntity QuerySets has changed with order_by() on fields with NULL values.
        # In 'creme_core/templates' :
            - The <body> of the pages should now have an attribute 'data-bricks-reload-url' which contains the bricks-reloading URL.
            - In 'base.html', {% block bodyclass %} has been removed ; use {% block body_classes %} instead (beware, you have to remove 'class="').
            - Many changes in 'detailview.html' :
                - The <div> for buttons have changed their CSS class.
                - The class 'zone_spacer_5px' is not used anymore & the related <div> has been removed.
                - Several template {% block %} have been removed:
            - In 'generics/view_entity.html', if you override some {% block %} ('title', 'logo', 'entity_buttons'),
              you have now to use the header brick feature instead (by creating your own or override an existing one).
            - In 'generics/blockform/base.html', 'generics/blockformset/base.html' & 'generics/form/base.html',
              the context variable 'logo' is replaced by 'icon_name' (eg: 'images/add_64.png' => 'add')
            - In form pages, the tags <table class="table_header" ...>  have been replaced by <div> tags.
            - Many changes in the HTML of list-views ; mostly in header & footer.
        # In 'creme_core.gui' :
            - The constructor of 'bricks.Brick' (aliased to 'block.Block' for compatibility) should be called if you write your own 'Brick' class.
            - In 'bricks._BrickRegistry.register_4_model()' the argument 'block' has been renamed 'brick_class'. A registered bricks should have an id_ == None.
            - 'fields_config.FieldsConfigRegistry.register()' has been removed.
            - The module 'list_view_import' has been renamed to 'mass_import'.
            - In the method 'listview.ListViewState.set_sort()', the argument 'field_name' has been renamed 'cell_key'.
        # The URL '/creme_core/list_view/import/..' became '/creme_core/mass_import/...' ; the GET argument 'list_url' is not used anymore.
        # In 'creme_core.views' :
            - In 'generic.listview.list_view()' the parameter '*args' has been removed.
            - In 'creme_property.add_properties_bulk()',: the IDs of entities are not read in GET arguments if not found in POST data anymore.
            - The function 'list_view_export.dl_listview_header()' has been removed.
            - In 'quick_forms.add_from_widget()' there is no "<json>" tag in the response anymore.
            - In 'relation.add_relations_bulk()', the IDs of subject-entities are not read in GET arguments if not found in POST data anymore.
        # The key 'usertheme' has been removed from 'creme_core.global_info'.
        # In 'creme_core.forms' :
            - In 'fields' :
                - The property 'user' is required by the method 'clean()' of: (Multi)GenericEntityField, (Multi)RelationEntityField, (Multi)CreatorEntityField.
                - The method 'GenericEntityField._update_wigets_choices()' has been renamed '_update_widget_choices()'.
                - The method 'CreatorEntityField.create_action_url()' now returns '' if no related quick-form is registered (& no custom URL is provided).
            - In 'bulk' :

== Version 1.6 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The version of Django has been upgraded to 1.8.
        - There is now an integrated migration system, which is better than South. Only the command 'migrate' is needed & 'syncdb' is useless.
        - The new hint system performs some useful checking, like the apps dependencies.
    # A new feature has been added: FieldsConfig.
      It allows the users to hide fields everywhere in Creme (forms, blocks, listview...), directly in the "General configuration".
    # The blocks configurations can now be set by role.
    # Global search:
        - The search configuration can now be specific to a role ; configuration per user has been removed.
        - The configuration UI of search has been improved.
    # GenericEntityField and MultipleGenericEntityField can now create entities on-the-fly.
    # The quick search (search with listview columns headers) is now available for ManyToManyFields.
    # The emptying of the trash works now better with trashed entities linked between them.
      We try to delete the remaining entities (which could not be deleted because of relationships) when there are errors,
      while the previous iteration managed to remove some entities. It will not work with cyclic references (but it is certainly very unusual).
    # Model-fields as choices are now alphabetically ordered in forms (eg: search configuration, report-graphs forms...).
    # Lots of labels in inner popups buttons have been improved. eg: 'Save' -> 'Save the alert'.
    # The display of History block has been improved (FK to CremeEntity, fields with choices).
    # DecimalFields are now displayed with a localised format.
    # The command 'creme_uninstall' has been heavily improved (more robust, clean more models, better display...).
    # Apps:
        * Projects :
            - The design of the tasks of project has been reworked.
              The ProjectTasks are not Activities anymore ; but instead they are linked to Activities which replace the Workingperiods ;
              the ProjectTasks still have the following fields: start, end, duration, description.
              The Contact linked to a Resource can now be changed ; but a Resource cannot be deleted if it is related to an Activity
              (before, the related WorkingPeriods were deleted too).
            - A Contact can now be created directly in the Resource form.
        * Tickets :
            - Tickets which are open since more than 7 days are displayed in red in the listview.
            - When a ticket is cloned, the status of the new ticket is 'Open', and its 'closing_date' is not copied.
            - The titles are not unique anymore.
            - Tickets have now a unique number.
        * Documents :
            - Two Folders can now be merged.
            - A new block is available for the Folders: "Child folders".
            - The Folders are now unique by ('title', 'parent_folder', 'category').
            - The model FolderCategory has a 'is_custom' field.
              Populated categories which are required for related documents and crudity attachments, are not custom (ie: not deletable) anymore.
        * Persons :
            - Contact has a new field: full_position ('Detailed position').
            - The Contact/Organisation blocks for information & details are now built with the CustomBlock feature.
            - The name of the billing & shipping addresses is not asked anymore. They are automatically named.
        * Commercial :
            - A Market Segment can now be deleted (by replacing them by another one). The related property type is also replaced.
            - A Market Segment "All the organisations" has been added, with no related PropertyType.
        * Billing :
            - Invoice's total can now be negative.
            - The blocks for entity information are now built with the CustomBlock feature.
            - The model TemplateBase has now a 'Status' FunctionField.
            - When a related billing document is created, the source Organisation in not chosen in a separated innerpopup window anymore.
        * Activities :
            - The participants can now be created directly in the forms.
            - The max length of the field Activity.place is now 500 (it was 100).
        * Mobile :
            - The call minutes can be added from the call form.
    # Upgrade notes:
        - If you changed the setting INSTALLED_APPS (or INSTALLED_DJANGO_APPS), "mediagenerator" must be replaced by "creme.creme_core.apps.MediaGeneratorConfig",
          as in the vanilla creme.settings.py file.

    Breaking changes :
    ------------------
        # Changes caused by Django 1.5 :
            - Accessing reverse one-to-one relations fetched via select_related() now raises DoesNotExist instead of returning None.
            - In URLField, the argument 'verify_exists' has been deleted.
            - The commands should use self.stdout.write() & self.stderr.write() instead of 'print'.
            - django.utils.simplejson has been replaced by 'json'.
            - The methods Paginator.next_page_number() & Paginator.previous_page_number() raise InvalidPage exception, instead of returning '0'.
              So the footer of the listview (template) has been fixed.
            - The function django.utils.timezone.localtime() crashes if its arg is None.
            - The django validation message "Enter a valid e-mail address." has changed (now it's "Enter a valid email address.") ; some unit tests could fail.
            - _CremeTestCase.assertXMLEqual() has been renamed assertXMLEqualv2() to avoid the shadowing of the Django's method.
        # Changes caused by Django 1.6 :
            - The forms' Meta should have a 'fields' attribute (or an 'exclude' one).
            - The session is now serialized as JSON, so stored objects must be serializable.
            - The test runner & the test files layout have changed.
              Eg: the old command "python manage test persons" has become "python manage test creme.persons.tests".
                - The python files 'foo.py' must be renamed 'test_foo.py'.
                - CSVImportBaseTestCaseMixin has moved to 'creme.creme_core.tests.views.base'.
                - The command 'test_creme' has been removed ('test creme' is OK).
            - BooleanField default is now 'None' (so 'False' should be set explicitly).
            - The entry Field.default_error_messages['invalid'] has been removed.
            - The CONTENT_TYPE key in test response is not available anymore (-> QUERY_STRING can be used instead with different value).
            - XViewMiddleware has been removed from settings.py.
            - There was a low level change in the SQLite backend + date format of dates as group key.
            - The error messages should use mapping keys instead of positional formatting. Some django error messages has changed, so some tests could fail.
        # Changes caused by Django 1.7 :
            - With the new AppConfig system, the files "creme_core_register.py" are not loaded anymore
                at startup & should not be used anymore; use CremeAppConfig instead.
            - Some imports have to be done lazily in order to avoid AppRegistryNotReady exceptions at startup.
            - The loading of models has changed, and errors caused by loop imports could happen.
            - django.forms.util has been renamed django.forms.utils.
            - The new migrations system caused many changes :
                - The model auth.User is not used anymore ; Creme has its own CremeUser model
                  Use the function get_user_model() or settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL to get it.
                - The old South migrations do not work anymore ; generate new migration files with the new command 'makemigrations'.
                  BEWARE : if you use ForeignKeys/ManyToManyFields/... to the old 'User' model, you'll have to rework the generated migrations (see vanilla apps)
                - You have to add a deconstruct() method to your custom model fields.
            - Do not use settings.INSTALLED_APPS in your code ; use django.apps.apps instead.
                Do not use settings.INSTALLED_CREME_APPS ; use django.apps.apps or creme_registry instead.
            - The commands which inherit AppCommand should implements handle_app_config() instead of handle_app().
            - The middleware configuration has been improved :
                - django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware has been added.
                - django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware has been added.
                - The order is the same than in the Django 1.7 settings template.
        # Changes caused by Django 1.8 :
            - The method QuerySet.select_related() now validates that the given fields actually exist.
              Previously, non-existent fields were silently ignored. Now, an error is raised.
            - The result of the method Meta.get_all_related_objects() has changed ; it's deprecated too.
            - ContentType.name is not a real field anymore ; you cannot perform query on it.
            - The module django.contrib.formtools has been removed ; it's a third party app now.
            - The module django.core.context_processors has moved to 'django.template.context_processors'.
            - Some private classes move from django.template to django.template.base, like VariableNode.
            - The method URLField.to_python() no longer adds a trailing slash to pathless URLs (it made some unit tests fail in 'vcfs').
            - The super methods setUpClass()/tearDownClass)()  must be called in test cases.
            - The instances of RequestContext are not filled by the context processors when they are built anymore, but only before the template rendering.
              So you'll probably need the new creme.creme_core.views.blocks.build_context() function for your own block reloading views.
            - The length of EmailFields is now 254 by default. CremeUser/Contact/Organisation have been migrated.
            - The commands should now use the method add_arguments(), based on 'argparse' (not 'optparse' anymore).
            - Some changes in the session implementation can make some low level tests fail.
            - Some changes in the DB management in unit tests can make some tests fail.
            - The settings for the templates configuration have changed.
              The setting TEMPLATES replace the settings TEMPLATE_* (eg: TEMPLATE_LOADERS...) which are now deprecated.
        # Upgrade of several JavaScript libraries :
            - "Jquery" (1.11.2).
                - For 'checked' property use the prop() method instead of attr() (see jquery doc).
                - Tip: add the plugin jquery-migrate (1.2.1) whichs prevents compatibilities issues with previous jquery releases
                       and show deprecation warnings (see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/warnings.md).
            - "Jquery-ui" (1.11.4).
            - "Form" (3.51) (the changes written for 2.94 have been ported too).
            - "Chosen" (0.9.15) (the changes written for 0.9.8 have been ported too).
            - "Fullcalendar" (1.6.7).
            - "Qunit" (1.18).
        # The CremeEntity sub-classes should now have a method get_create_absolute_url() (excepted auxiliary ones).
        # The module 'creme_core.utils.contribute_to_model' has been removed (use model swapping instead).
        # In creme_core.utils.meta :
            - The function get_related_field() has been removed (its behaviour was very different with the underlying Django fields changes).
            - The function get_model_field_info() has been removed (it was deprecated).
            - The function get_verbose_field_name() has been removed (it was deprecated).
        # The template "creme_core/generics/blockform/add_popup.html" has been removed.
        # The tag 'enumerable' tag is now True by default in ManyToManyFields.
        # The constructor BasePopulator.init() takes 2 additional arguments ('stdout' & 'style').
        # The 'extra_q' argument of generic.listview.list_view_content (and so list_view() & list_view_popup_from_widget() which use it)
          can not contains a sub-queryset condition anymore (you'll get SerializationError) ; convert them into list.
        # GenericEntityField & MultipleGenericEntityField need the "user" attribute (for creation permissions).
        # In (Multi)CreatorEntityField, the hack which consisted to write "myfield.create_action_url = myfield.create_action_url" in order
          to activate the creation button on fields with q_filter does not work anymore. Use "myfield.force_creation = True" instead.
        # About RelationEntityField.allowed_rtypes (ie the setter & the constructor's attribute) : if an object evaluated to False was passed,
          all RelationTypes were allowed. This behaviour has been removed ; use RelationType.objects.all() instead.
        # In FilteredEntityTypeField, 'None' is not a valid parameter anymore for the constructor (but the default behavior did not change).
        # The widget Label displays its 'empty_label' if its value is evaluated to False (before: only if it was 'None').
        # When a Q() is used as 'limit_choices_to' attribute of a RelatedField in a CremeEntity, hide the field or set a custom form for inner-edition
          or it will cause a ValueError exception. The other cases are handled.
        # SearchConfigItem :
            - create_if_needed(): the argument 'user' has been replaced by the argument 'role'.
            - get_4_model() has been removed (it was deprecated).
        # The following JavaScript functions have been removed (they were deprecated).
            - creme.utils.bindShowHideTbody().
            - creme.utils.handleResearch().
            - creme.lv_widget.handleSelection().
            - creme.lv_widget.delete_a_value().
        # The view "/creme_core/enumerable/<content_type>/json" now returns a list of dicts instead of a list of tuples.
        # The middleware LogImportedModulesMiddleware has been removed.
        # Apps :
            * Billing :
                - The classes Base (parent of Invoice, Quote...) and Line (parent of ProductLine & ServiceLine) are now abstract classes.

== Version 1.5 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # Mobile, a new app. It provides 3 views which are specifically adapted to the cellphones.
        - The 'Home' page displays the Activities in progress and the Activities of the days.
        - The 'Directory' page displays the favorite Contacts and Organisations (and their employees).
        - The 'Activities' page displays the delayed phone calls, the activities without date and the activities planned the next day.
        - You can search Contacts & Organisations, and create them.
        - When you click on a phone number, and come back to the browser at the end of the call, a workflow panel allows you to
          create a phonecall Activity (if it did not exist) and set its status.
        - The (alternative) login view is on the URL '/mobile/login/'.
    # Geolocation, a new app. It adds some geolocation features for the Contact and Organisation addresses.
      For the time being, it uses only GoogleMaps service. 3 new blocks are available :
        - "Maps" shows the location(s) of a Contact/Organisation in a map by using their addresses ; the latitude and the longitude can be manually dragged on the map.
        - "Maps By Filter" shows the locations of all Contacts or Organisations for a given filter.
        - "Around this address" shows all the neighbours of a selected address ; the neighbours can be filtered.
    # A detail view for the PropertyTypes, which shows the tagged entities, has been added.
    # The inner/bulk edition has been improved :
        - The widgets are the same the full form ones, and so :
            - The creator widgets are now used with configurable models (eg: Invoice.status).
            - The ForeignKeys to CremeEntities are now well managed (eg: Contact.image).
            - The ManyToManyFields are now supported (eg: Image.categories).
        - The form of a specific field can be customized in order to manage correctly its business logic (see 'Apps' section).
        - The support of related sub-fields (eg: Contact.billing_address__city) has been added.
    # List view :
        - The quick search on properties is now possible.
        - The natural ordering of the models is now applied as default for listview (eg: Organisation are ordered by their name).
          When a column is selected for ordering, both column order and default order are applied.
    # EntityFilters :
        - They can now be private ; it means that they can only be used by their owner.
        - The conditions on FK fields (eg: Invoice.status) can now use a multi-selection.
        - The Empty/NotEmpty operators are enabled only when a field can be null.
        - The Date fields (regular & custom ones) now supports the Empty/NotEmpty operators.
        - The EntityFilters created by the 'populate' scripts (ie: not custom) are now editable (but not deletable, and their name is not editable); their are versioned too.
          Their owner is now the first super-user (in order not all users can edit them).
          The versionning means that when a populate script is run again, if the script tries to create a filter which already exists (ie: its PK exists) :
            - if the new version would have the same conditions, the name of the existing filter is updated (in order to fix a potential typo).
            - if the conditions are different, a new filter with the old one PK as base for its own PK (plus a version mark) is created ; the name is versioned too.
    # Listviews Views (HeaderFilters) :
        - They can now be private ; it means that they can only be used by their owner.
        - The Views created by the 'populate' scripts (ie: not custom) are now editable (but not deletable).
          So, when the scripts are run again, the existing Views are not modified anymore (in order to keep the modifications of the users).
    # Global search :
        - The view uses now the GET method, so back button works well now.
        - The results blocks are now paginated.
        - The search on a model can be disabled in creme_config.
    # The CSV import can now set the CustomFields values.
    # You can now create an Entity "on the fly" with the multi-select widget for Entities.
    # A User and its related Contact are now synchronised (ie: first_name, last_name & email remain equal).
    # The autocompletion has been added to several forms, to select a content type or a relationship type.
    # The non mandatory instances are not re-created anymore when the command 'creme_populate' is run.
    # The ordering of models has been improved: lots of models are now ordered by name/title.

            - A Report can (again) be created with no column.
            - The download form has been improved.

            - The "volatile" links have been improved :
                - Their name is always up to date & localized.
                - When a link becomes invalid, the error is displayed in creme_config.
                - They can be any valid/compatible relationship/FK, and not only the ones which correspond to a column of the related Report.
            - The export view now uses GET parameters, so it can be bookmarked for example.
        * Activities :
            - The type of an Activity can now be edited (and not only its sub-type).
            - The Organisations of the participants can be automatically added as subjects (it can be configured and it is enabled by default).
            - The Activities can now be imported (ie: CSV/Excel files).
            - When a team is selected to be a participant, its teammates participate.
        * Persons:
            - You can now merge 2 Contacts if one of them is a user (but not 2).
            - A field 'order' has been added to StaffSize.
            - The field Organisation.siren is not unique anymore.
        * Creme_config :
            - You can not link an existing Contact when you create a User anymore.
            - SettingKey & SettingValue :
                - The values have a prettier display in their block (eg: 'True' is now a localized "Yes").
                - The descriptions are correctly localized.
            - The permissions for the views which configure RelationTypes, PropertyTypes, Blocks... have changed from 'creme_config.can_admin' to 'creme_core.can_admin'.
              The related portals do not need specific permissions anymore.
        * Commercial :
            - Commercial action :
                - A counted entity can be directly created with a quick form, from the objectives block.
                - A linked opportunity can be directly created from the 'Related opportunities' block.
        * Recurrents :
            - The field RecurrentGenerator.periodicity is now a DatePeriodField. It allows more accurate periodicity :
              for example, you can set a real 'monthly' period, which is not equal to 30 days.
            - The wizard form is now closer to other forms.
        * Emails :
            - The available sender address of the EmailCampaigns is now stored in a SettingValue.

                - creme.utils.simpleConfirm()
                - creme.utils.postNReload()
        # The 'user' argument was removed from several methods :
            - Relation.populate_real_object_entities()
            - CremeEntity.populate_relations()
            - EntityCell.populate_entities()
            - HeaderFilter.populate_entities()
        # The method CremeEntity.get_edit_absolute_url() now returns '' (and not an invalid URL anymore) which means 'No edition' ;
          the base templates/templatetags use this official behaviour (view_entity.html, {% get_edit_button ... %}).
        # _BulkUpdateRegistry.register() args have changed. It is not anymore a list of tuples (model, list_of_field_names),
          but now it allows to register only a model at once, an optional list of field names, and an optional dict of custom forms.
        # ManyToManyFields are now inner-editable by default ; so you have to manage them with bulk_update_registry.register(MyModel, ...)
          if it causes a business logic problem (by excluding them, or adding a custom form for them).
        # SettingKey & SettingValue :
            - The SettingKey class is not a model anymore ; the SettingKey instances should be created
              in a setting_keys.py file and registered in your creme_core_register.py (see setting_key_registry).
            - The model SettingValue :
                - It has moved to creme_core (creme_core.models.setting_value.py).
                - The field  'key' (ForeignKey) has been replaced by a 'key_id' field (CharField) ;
                  so you could have to change some of your queries (eg: '.filter(key=MY_KEY)' --> '.filter(key_id=MY_KEY)').
        # HeaderFilter.create() :
            - It does not modify an existing HeaderFilter anymore.
            - The owner cannot be a staff user.
        # EntityFilter.create() :
            - If the argument 'is_custom' is False, you have to give the conditions as argument too (this is a new argument) ;
              a new filter is created if the conditions (or the 'use_or' field) are different ; if there are identitical, the name is updated.
            - The owner cannot be a staff user anymore.
            - The characters '[]' are now forbidden in the PK (ValueError).
            - The 'ct' & the 'is_custom' value can not be changed if there is already an existing filter (ValueError).
        # _FieldPrintersRegistry :
            - The functions registered as field printers take now an additional 'field' argument.
            - The attributes css_default_listview & css_default_header_listview have been removed.
            - The method get_listview_css_class_for_field() & get_header_listview_css_class_for_field() can not take 'None' as argument anymore.
        # Templatetags :
            - 'enumerate' has been removed.
            - 'print_boolean' always returns a boolean widget (it does not check if the argument is a boolean anymore).
        # CSV import : ImportForm._post_instance_creation() takes now an additional argument 'updated'.
        # Reminders :
            - The Reminder class has changed :
                - The attribute 'id_' has been renamed 'id'.
                - The attribute 'model_' has been renamed 'model'.
            - The models which can be reminded must have a boolean field called 'reminded' (so assistants.ToDo & assistants.Alert have been updated).
        # The class creme.creme_core.core.entity_cell.EntityCellRegularField has changed : the property 'field_info' returns now a FieldInfo instance.
        # The variable settings.SHOW_HELP has been removed.
        # Apps :
            * Recurrents :
                - The forms given to the registry must take a new 'ct' argument ; the 'initial' argument is not set anymore.

== Version 1.4 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # The HeaderFilter (listviews Views) form has a new UI :
        - You can now choose the order for all columns.
        - The UI is more compact and friendly (filter, search, drag n' drop).
    # Customisable object & relation blocks. You can choose the same fields as in HeaderFilter form (& the UI is very close too).
    # EntityFilter :
        - A new condition is available for ForeignKeys to User : current user.
        - The operators are now filtered according to the selected field's type (regular & custom fields).
        - Enumerable field choices are now displayed in a combobox (instead of a simple text field).
    # CSV import can now update existing entities instead of always creating them ; you can select several fields that act as a key.
    # The 'Ice cream' theme has been improved again : better contrast, separation lines, drop shadows...
    # There are some User management enhancements :
        - The super users can now deactivate common users from creme_config (ie: in a graphical manner).
        - The field User.is_staff is now used by Creme : the staff users are hidden from other users, and they cannot be selected to own entities for example.
          The staff users are used to help the other users, but they should not participate in the business.
          Staff users are created by the django command 'createsuperuser' (but the first super user created after the syncdb command is not a staff user).
    # Minor UI improvements in forms :
        - Labels for submit buttons are now better ; for example 'Save the contact' instead of 'Submit' in the Contact creation form.
        - A 'Cancel' button is available in lots of forms.
        - A new JavaScript widget (CheckListSelect) is now used for multi-selecting without ordering : it uses check boxes and allows filtering/searching.
        - The order of the buttons in popups is now : OK/Cancel.
        - A new field to select several entities MultiCreatorEntityField replaces MultiCremeEntityField (but it does not allow inline creation yet).
    # Improved CSS for list views (fields are aligned differently according to their type).
    # A new pager for blocks has been added ; it manages large numbers of pages better.
    # A new command, called 'creme_uninstall', has been added : it can uninstall a Creme app in the good way.
    # A Unicode Collation Algorithm (derived from pyuca) is used to sort :
        - The apps in the menu, the creme_config portal, the UserRoles configuration.
        - The fields in the HeaderFilter form & in the search configuration.
        - The ContentTypes in <select>.
        - ...
    # JavaScript : some fallbacks for IE8 & 9 have been added. The support of IE 7 has been dropped.
    # The column titles in the list views are always up-to-date (before, they were computed during columns edition).
    # The error handling in inner popups has been improved.
    # A view for 409 errors has been created.
    # Apps :
        * Polls, a new app :
            - You can create a PollForm, which contains questions organised in sections, sub-sections etc...
            - Questions have a type (string, integer, boolean, enumeration...).
            - Questions can have conditions on previous questions : a question is activated only if its conditions are filled.
            - You can create several PollReplies from a PollForm, which snapshot the questions of the form.
            - A PollReply can be filled with a wizard, and answers can be edited later.
            - The PollReplies can be grouped by PollCampaigns.
        * Reports :
            * When you create a new Report, you can only select the columns from an existing HeaderFilter.
            * A new UI for the columns edition has been added, and it uses the work on the new HeaderFilter form.
            * ReportGraphs :
                - The form has been improved. Example : the field 'Is count' is already checked if there is no available aggregable field.
                - Only the ForeignKeys related to enumerable models are available (see the notes on 'enumerable' tag below) for the abscissa.
                - CustomFields are now available for abscissa & ordinate.
                - The graph design has been heavily enhanced. The data is emphasized by a clearer display :
                  many useless/annoying visual elements were removed, legends are better, many glitches were fixed...
            * Several behaviours have been fixed :
                - The column titles are now always up-to-date (before, they were computed during columns edition).
                - The 1st level entities are filtered by credentials ('view' permission).
                - When a FK field is linked to a sub-report, if a related entity does not pass the subfilter, the line is not dropped any more (related values are just empty).
                - The flattened sub-reports (ie not expanded, see 'selected' attribute) in columns associated to ManyToManyField/ForeignKey/related fields are now used.
                - The flattened sub-reports manage now all types of columns.
                - The aggregates are computed in a scope (so result may be different with an aggregate in a sub-report).
            * Invalid columns are automatically removed (eg: removed CustomField).
        * Activities, the calendar has been heavily improved :
            * The version of fullcalendar.js has been updated from 1.4.5 to 1.4.7.
            * A new menu has been created, with :
                - Floating activities ; they can be drag n' dropped on the calendar, and filtered by their name.
                - All your calendars & the public calendars of all the other users.
                  Several calendars can be shown together (they have different colors) and they can be filtered by their name, or the first name and last name of their owner.
        * Billing :
            - The creation and the edition of billing lines have been redesigned, in order to use more client side computation.
            - A new field 'acceptation_date' (DateField) has been added to the Quote model.
            - A new field 'pending_payment' (BooleanField) has been added to the InvoiceStatus model.
            - 3 function fields are dynamically added by the 'billing' app to the models Organisation and Contact :
                - Total of pending payment.
                - Total number of won quotes this year.
                - Total number of won quotes last year.
        * Opportunities :
            - Opportunity.target field is now editable.
        * Products:
            - 'images' are now displayed in a true block (Products & Services).
        * Projects :
            - The Project.name field is not nullable anymore.

  Developers side :
  -----------------
    Non breaking changes :
    ----------------------
        # A new field tag has been created : 'enumerable'. When a ForeignKey is tagged as enumerable, it means that the related model
          can be enumerated, ie there are a limited number of instances. Eg : persons.models.Position are enumerable, but not persons.models.Address.
        # JavaScript :
            * A basic object derivation support (see creme.component.Component) has been added.
            * A simple event handling tool (creme.component.EventHandler) has been added.
            * The 'disabled' attribute now works with widgets.

                - PolymorphicSelect.
                - DynamicSelect.
            * The popup system has been refactored :
                - creme.utils.simpleConfirm() is deprecated ; use creme.dialogs.confirm() instead.
                - You should use creme.utils.showInnerPopup() only for compatibility with actual popup templates (see creme_core/templates/creme_core/inner_popup.html)
                - creme.dialog.Dialog is the new base dialog object.
                - creme.dialog.ConfirmDialog shows a message and has OK/Cancel buttons.
                - creme.dialog.FormDialog has Save/Cancel buttons and handles form errors.
                - creme.dialog.SelectDialog has OK/Cancel buttons and an API to return a value when it is closed.
                - Many helper functions were added in creme.dialogs.
            * The AJAX actions have been improved :
                - creme.utils.postNReload() is deprecated ; use creme.blocks.ajaxPOSTQuery() instead.
                - A new API for requests has been added : creme.ajax.Query.
                - Many helper functions were added in creme.utils and creme.blocks for AJAX actions with confirmation, reloading and error dialogs.
        # New form fields were added : MultiCTypeChoiceField & MultiEntityCTypeChoiceField. They use the cache of ContentType.
        # CremeEntityField & MultiCremeEntityField form fields are now deprecated ; ListViewWidget too.
          use CreatorEntityField & MultiCreatorEntityField instead.
        # The function creme_core.utils.Q_creme_entity_content_types() is now deprecated.
        # The old migration scripts have been folded.
        # Apps :
            * Activities :
                - Calendar now has a field 'color'.
            * Billing:
                - The following constants are deprecated : PERCENT_PK, AMOUNT_PK & DISCOUNT_UNIT.
            * Opportunities:
                - The methods Opportunity.get_target() & Opportunity.get_source() are now deprecated.
            * Reports :
                - The code has been heavily refactored, and a lot of work is now done in the new reports.core module.

    Breaking changes :
    ------------------
        # The model HeaderFilterItem has been removed, & HeaderFilter now stores the columns in a new field called 'json_cells'.

== Version 1.3 ==

  Users side :
  ------------
    # Form widgets improvements :
        * New selector widgets, that can also create instances (and automatically
          select the newly created instances).

    # The project layout has changed with Django 1.4 :
        - Apps are imported with namespace 'creme' (eg: 'creme.persons' instead of 'persons').
        - The script 'manage.py' is now at the root of the project.
    # Root 'urls.py' generates now automatically urls of all Creme apps : so you don't have to modify this file when you add an app anymore.
    # Credentials changes:
        * Permissions method in CremeEntity are now deprecated, and replaced by new methods in User.
            - CremeEntity.can_*{_or_die} methods are deprecated : use User.has_perm_to_*{_or_die} methods instead.
            - CremeEntity.populate_credentials is deprecated (delete the uses, because they are now useless).
        * The view creme_core.views.generic.edit.edit_model_with_popup() checks now the CremeEntity edition credentials (when the given model is a CremeEntity of course).
        * The credentials on models are now possible (eg: you can know if the user could link a Contact that is not created yet).

    # In CremeAbstractEntity class 'excluded_fields_in_html_output' and 'header_filter_exclude_fields' attributes have been removed (tags are used instead).
    # New attribute in CremeModel (so, in CremeEntity), 'creation_label', that contains the (localized) string used by forms, buttons etc... that create instances.
    # The code manages better the invalidation of model fields.
      HeaderFilters, EntityFilters & Histories check now at runtime if they handle invalid fields (and they modify themselves to ignore them).
    # New model field : 'CTypeForeignKey'. It uses the cache of ContentType manager, when ForeignKey(ContentType, ...) does not.
    # Unit tests for JavaScript code.
    # Blocks system :
        - Dependencies can be '*' (that means: "all models").
        - New attribute 'read_only' (boolean) ; if it is set to True, reloading this block will not force the blocks which share its dependencies to be reloaded too.

        - App names are simply the final arguments (no more '-a' argument).

    # The unused view '/creme_core/entity/json' has been removed.
    # The form widget 'UploadedFileWidget' has been removed.
